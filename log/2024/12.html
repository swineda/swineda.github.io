            <div class="entry">
                <h2>HAPPY SNAKE DAY!!!!!!</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="logged">SNAKE DAY @20:57</span>
        
                    <br><br>Don't you just love how the snake and its team of liars and manipulators - I mean "PR team" - came up with yet another haphazard - and frankly tacky - excuse/coverup to try and make taylorsnake's history of appropriations appear intended and not the mindless, nonsensical, inconsistent hodgepodge collection of identities and plagiarisms that it actually is? That the snake was supposedly going though "ERAS" ü§Æ, and not mindlessly following and plagiarizing whatever person/trend was popular during these times????? Yeah. <i>Suuuuuuure.</i> I TOTALLY believe that.

                    <br><br>Note: this is all after I called it out years prior (on 05/27/2022, at 10:59am) in this post when I wrote,<a href="https://www.tumblr.com/fucknotaylorswift/685427394092400640/users-gonna-use-part-2-since-not-even-tumblrs?source=share" target="_blank"?>"how can [it] be [...] country yet club/house, mainstream yet indie, outcast yet popular [...] at the same time??"</a>. Answer: it can't and it's not.

                    <br><br>It's funny because they think they're being clever by coming up with this tacky notion of "ERAS" ü§Æ (to cover up for the snake's nonsensical, inconsistent hodgepodge of identities), but in reality, that same tacky notion is not only a perfect encapsulation, but also <i>actually an admission</i>, of taylorsnake's superficiality. Tell me, what happens when the snake has finished stealing and using someone's identity, idea, or trend? It throws it out and moves on to stealing and using someone else's identity, idea, or trend - which the whole idea of this idiot's "ERAS" ü§Æ, right? Committing different acts of intellectual, identity, and property theft? That's what this snake is admitting?
                    
                    <br><br>Again, it thinks it's being clever by putting this pretense to obfuscate its appropriations, but what it's really doing is taking these different subcultures at face value and uses them as facades. If you think about it, you can really only be country yet club/house, mainstream yet indie, outcast yet popular at the same time if you have no underlying identity of your own. What's more, it should actually be insulting to people who ARE nerds, indie, into the club scene, etc. because these aren't just ephemeral trends that the members who are a part of these communities don to make themselves look like something they're not, or to be popular, it's who they are intrinsically and will continue to be throughout the progression of their lives.

                    <br><br>And this is yet another example of why this stupid disgusting cüêçnt is so toxic and regressive to our society. Because it inspires laziness and superficiality. taylorsnake wants to trick you into thinking it's the biggest celebrity in the world (<a href="https://medium.com/@taylorsnake/payola-payola-payola-52dead5f2e70" target="_blank">when it's really not</a>) and make you think this kind of appropriation is okay. But it's not. What this is is taylorsnake appealing to people's baser instincts and the lowest common denominator yet again. It is <s>the blind leading the blind</s> the basic leading the basic.

                    <br><br>So, no, the snake hasn't been going through "ERAS" ü§Æ like it wants to trick you into believing it has throughout its DECADES LONG EXISTENCE INTO ITS CURRENT OLD AGE. taylorsnake is and has always been the basic, untalented, unoriginal, plagiarizing, thieving idiot with no identity of its own (and who responds to valid criticism by making up haphazard - and frankly tacky - excuses and lies to cover up the truth) this entire time. <b>AND HERE'S TO ANOTHER YEAR OF APPROPRIATION, THEFT, MANIPULATIONS, AND HARASSMENT, YOU OLD CüêçNT!!!!!!!!!!</b>

                    <br><br>Oh no! I shouldn't have exposed all of that about the snake cause now that idiot is going to retaliate! What is going to do, I wonder? <a href="/log/2024/12.html#03:13">Steal my packages</a>, color condition me, disturb the peace and my sleep, <a href="/log/2024/12.html#FREE-PUBLICITY-FOR-THE-SNAKE!!!">harass me with spam</a>?

                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2024/12/12/image1.png">

                    <br><br>Note how they used this minion to message me typically at the end of my work day. The perverts know from stalking me when I'm about to stop working for the day, and right when I'm about to leave my computer/log off they have minions like this message me at that exact time to try and force me to continue working so I never stop working. What's the lesson to be learned here? To not work hard or be nice/accommodating towards others? It's like these idiots want me to become as putrid and misanthropic as they are.

                    <br><br>This also the perverts way of trying and force me out of my apartment everyday so they get material from these interactions and so I'm exposed to their color-condition everyday and cannot externalize their "indoctrination".
                    
                    <br><br><a href="/assets/images/memes/ITS_A_GAME.jpg">

                    <br></br>Also note that the amount of messages and appointment requests I received from work have decreased by about half since I exposed Cuntney's contact info. Guess these minions got cared off ü§∑ Again, an example of the perverted idiots trying to force me to work nonstop during these 12+ hour work days for no reason other than to get material and have something to watch while I give tours to these fake prospects. Interesting how these minions are so careful and guarded about their own privacy, but they have no qualms invading mine and using the invasion of my life as an opportunity to get their 15 minutes of fame - just like the swine and snake. More regression a la the swine and snake; the perverted swine and snake inspiring others to become perverted swines and snakes. This is the type of unethical perversions they spread ü§∑
