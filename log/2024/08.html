                    <br><br>Perverts try to manipulate me into keeping my notification on by spamming me with messages of fake job offers. I usually keep my notifications off to prevent getting any of the perverts' spam attacks, but have had to keep them on these past couple of weeks so I don't miss any messages from an organization who is offering to help with my rent payments while I am temporarily disabled. Now that I have met with this organization, I have gone back to silencing all notifications. The perverts do not like that, because it eliminates their ability to harass me at anytime.

I also have not been able to generate income since then, due to the perverts' continual sabotage of every full-remote job offer I received. The perverts do not want me to work from home since that would not allow them the ability harass me at my workplace through mimicry, color conditioning, etc.

                    <br><br>Also note how how the perverts engineered this situation so that my eviction notice coincides with this months's full moon.

                    <br><br>Consider why a group of perverts would push so hard to have a specific candidate in that position of power if they didn't have anything to gain from it. What could this mean for your rights and privacy if the perverts elect a candidate who they are able to manipulate and control, and pass legislature that legalizes their perversions.

                    I would expect a grown adult journalist to be using more substantial references than a <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/jewishbarbies/726862660137779200/been-seeing-a-lot-of-stitches-of-this-with-woc?source=share">snake in arrested development who wishes to be seen as the popular girl in high school and whose "fan" base is comprised of children and pre-adolescents</a>. Definitely lost your credibility.

                    <br><br><span class="logged">edit 08/14/2024 @12:69</span> Also interesting to see them reference <a href="/perverts.html#taylorsnake">#taylorsnake</a> in a piece endorsing a Democratic nominee when <a href="/perverts.html#taylorsnake">#taylorsnake</a> knows nothing about politics or is even registered as Democrat, much less votes as one... <i>if at all</i>. ðŸ¤·

                    Perverts have minions slam their doors after I post <a href="/log/2024/08.html#11:00">earlier entry about door slamming</a>.

                    Perverts disrupt my sleep by having <a href="/minions.html#aSavitckii">minion</a> slam their door repeatedly. Perverts know (from stalking me) that I went to sleep around 5am - 6am the night before and would only get about 4 hours of sleep before being woken up.<br>

                    <br>This is the perverts' way of retaliating at me for starting to outline and reveal their past acts of human rights violations and sexual harassment.

                    <br>Also perverts' way of trying to get me to give them material on cue. I take melatonin and go back to sleep for another 5 hours.

                    <br>Pretty sure that enduring years of perverts' sleep deprivation tactics has reduced my life span significantly and will have negative long-term effects on my health:

                    I begin logging events events starting from 2014 that reveal <a href="/perverts.html#swineda">swineda's</a> and the perverts' human right's violations and sexual harassment. Perverts have one of their minions slam their door to try to punish/stop me.
