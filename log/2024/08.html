                    Here's an example of subtle manipulation tricking you into thinking <a href="/perverts.html#taylorsnake">taylorsnake</a> is a legitimate celebrity, and not manufactured, by likening <a href="/perverts.html#taylorsnake">it</a> to BeyoncÃ©, putting them side-by-side as though <a href="/perverts.html#taylorsnake">it</a> measures up to BeyoncÃ©.
                    
                    <br><img src="/assets/images/2024/08/12/article.png">

                    <br>Also disconcerting to see what is supposed to be an esteemed publication speaking about a <a href="/perverts.html#taylorsnake">plagiarist</a> with such regard.

                    I would expect a grown adult journalist to be using more substantial references than a <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/jewishbarbies/726862660137779200/been-seeing-a-lot-of-stitches-of-this-with-woc?source=share">snake in arrested development who wishes to be seen as the popular girl in high school and whose "fan" base is comprised of children and pre-adolescents</a>. Definitely lost your credibility.

                    <br><span class="logged">edit 08/14/2024 @12:69</span> Also interesting to see them reference <a href="/perverts.html#taylorsnake">#taylorsnake</a> in a piece endorsing a Democratic nominee when <a href="/perverts.html#taylorsnake">#taylorsnake</a> knows nothing about politics or is even registered as Democrat, much less votes as one... <i>if at all</i>. ðŸ¤·

                    Perverts have minions slam their doors after I post <a href="/log/2024/08.html#11:00">earlier entry about door slamming</a>.

                    Perverts disrupt my sleep by having minion, <a href="/minions.html#ASavitckii">ASavitckii</a>, slam their door repeatedly. Perverts know (from stalking me) that I went to sleep around 5am - 6am the night before and would only get about 4 hours of sleep before being woken up.<br>

                    <br>This is the perverts' way of retaliating at me for starting to outline and reveal their past acts of human rights violations and sexual harassment.

                    <br>Also perverts' way of trying to get me to give them material on cue. I take melatonin and go back to sleep for another 5 hours.

                    <br>Pretty sure that enduring years of perverts' sleep deprivation tactics has reduced my life span significantly and will have negative long-term effects on my health:
