                    <br><br>It appears that the perverts are giving KðŸ’©mala the same kind of media treatment that they gave #taylorsnake, which led to the snake's artificial and manufactured "mega celebrity" status. 

                    <br><br>I don't care for KðŸ’©mala one way or the other. And while I believe that having TrðŸ’©mp back in the WH is regressive and dangerous, electing a candidate that is endorsed by the perverts (the same group of idiots who subvert and undermine your rights and our economy) is far more self-destructive.

                    <br><br>Consider why a group of perverts would push so hard to have a specific candidate in that position of power if they didn't have anything to gain from it. What could this mean for your rights and privacy if the perverts elect a candidate who they are able to manipulate and control, and pass legislature that legalizes their perversions.

                    <br><br>The next morning, I receive an email from the company providing explanation for the layoff, even though my removal happened almost a month ago.

                    <br><br>Insulting how the perverts think people are as stupid as they are, that they will just continue to fall for their (the perverts') deceit just because they send an email contradicting what I said, as part of a flimsy half-ðŸ’©ssed attempt at a cover-up. I guess that means they're not actually perverts who stalk and violate my privacy either! But if that's the case, how did orchestrate this response to a statement I made (on an unpublished document, from a private computer), if they weren't stalking me in the first place? 
                    
                    <br><br>It's like: <i>Hooray! The perverts sent an email contradicting something I said! Suddenly everything I said is untrue and all those layoffs never happened! Oh wait, yes they did and you and 100,000 more people are still unemployed. ðŸ¤·</i>

                    Here's an example of subtle manipulation tricking you into thinking <a href="/perverts.html#taylorsnake">taylorsnake</a> is a legitimate celebrity, and not manufactured, by likening <a href="/perverts.html#taylorsnake">it</a> to BeyoncÃ©, putting them side-by-side as though <a href="/perverts.html#taylorsnake">it</a> measures up to BeyoncÃ©.

                    <br>Also disconcerting to see what is supposed to be an esteemed publication speaking about a <a href="/perverts.html#taylorsnake">plagiarist</a> with such regard.

                    I would expect a grown adult journalist to be using more substantial references than a <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/jewishbarbies/726862660137779200/been-seeing-a-lot-of-stitches-of-this-with-woc?source=share">snake in arrested development who wishes to be seen as the popular girl in high school and whose "fan" base is comprised of children and pre-adolescents</a>. Definitely lost your credibility.

                    <br><br><span class="logged">edit 08/14/2024 @12:69</span> Also interesting to see them reference <a href="/perverts.html#taylorsnake">#taylorsnake</a> in a piece endorsing a Democratic nominee when <a href="/perverts.html#taylorsnake">#taylorsnake</a> knows nothing about politics or is even registered as Democrat, much less votes as one... <i>if at all</i>. ðŸ¤·

                    Perverts disrupt my sleep by having minion, <a href="/minions.html#ASavitckii">ASavitckii</a>, slam their door repeatedly. Perverts know (from stalking me) that I went to sleep around 5am - 6am the night before and would only get about 4 hours of sleep before being woken up.<br>
