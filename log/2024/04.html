                    <br><br>I meet with a Dr. J💩hn Mais💩no, a Physical Therapist, to inspect my ankle after I injured it 6 months earlier. The injury started out as a minor sprain and should have healed within 3 months but did not due to amount of the walking I had to do from my job. Moreover, instead of healing in that short amount of time, the injury actually worsened over time and spread over a larger area of my leg.

                    <br><br>Before this appointment, I have several conversations with friends and coworkers in which I state my intent to take some type of disability leave to allow my leg to heal and prevent permanent damage. In order for my leave to be approved by my employer, I would need a doctor's note vouching for this request.
                    
                    <br><br>The perverts, who are constantly stalking and violating my privacy, hear this and go ape-sh🐖t crazy at the idea of me taking time off from work (and essentially getting paid while doing nothing), since they cannot get material from me in that scenario. (This is ironic since that's basically the perverts' existence: they're profiting from stealing and copying my likeness and ideas while they sit on their fat ass🐖s doing nothing). 
                    
                    <br><br>As a result, the perverts have the Physical Therapist advise me to <i>not</i> take time off, so I'm not able to go on disability leave. Moreover, he advised me to do the exact opposite instead: walk more (which is what worsened my injury in the first place) and leave my apartment every day. 5 months later and my ankle is still injured. <i>Can you say malpractice suit?</i>

                    <br><br>I knew at the start of the appointment that this is would be the outcome simply from the fact that the Dr. J💩hn Mais💩no was wearing red and gray (on the front of his shirt). 

                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2024/04/24/image1.jpeg">
                    
                    <br><br>This is part of the perverts' narcissistic and sociopathic routine where they likes to leave a signature of some sort (using the rape codes they've created) on the people/organizations they've corrupted so I know that whatever attack or “misfortune” that comes along with the corruption was their doing. It's not enough for them to corrupt the environment around me, for some reason they need me to know it's them behind it. Also, the fact that the perverts instructed the doctor to tell me to leave my apartment everyday is a dead giveaway; it's the perverts' desperate attempt to try and have me leave my home, a safe place, so that I'm exposed and vulnerable to whatever mentally ill attacks they have planned.

                    <br><br>This is also is also similar to the time the perverts tried to prevent me from getting unemployment benefits from C💩shman & W💩kefield. TL:DR: I found it difficult to continue working at that company after years of color conditioning, mimicry, sleep-deprivation, and etc. psychological abuse that the perverts were trying to inflict on me, so I ended up calling out sick several times. In return, the perverts abused and perverted the company's policies by trying to frame my absences as truancy, in an effort to try and force me back to work thereby allowing them to continue their color conditioning, mimicry, sleep-deprivation, and etc. psychological abuse. Nonetheless, I continued to call out anyway for medical reasons; the perverts' sleep-deprivation tactics caused me to develop severe and chronic migraines, which the company recognized as a disability (another ingenuous display of idiocy). I was still worried that they would try to find another reason to fire me, so I began researching unemployment benefits. I found that one of the ways a company can deny an employee benefits is if they were fired for "gross misconduct". The perverts, who are constantly stalking and violating my privacy, see this and go ape-sh🐖t crazy at the idea of me taking time off from work (and essentially getting paid while doing nothing), since they cannot get material from me in that scenario. (This is ironic since that's basically the perverts' existence: they're profiting from stealing and copying my likeness and ideas while they sit on their fat ass🐖s doing nothing). As a result, they have C💩shman & W💩kefield fire me and use "gross misconduct" as the reason for the termination. Weeks later, I eventually qualify for unemployment, since they couldn't justify these claims.

                    <br><br>Note how stupid these perverts are: if they were successful and I had not gotten unemployment benefits, then I wouldn't have been able to attend my online educational program (months later), and they wouldn't have gotten 9+ months of daily material from it. And now, here they are again trying to repeat that same stupidity by trying to sabotage all of my job offers and evict me from my home. 🤷
