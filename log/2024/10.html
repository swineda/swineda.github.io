                    <br><br>You don't want people to "live in fear", you say? Sometimes that's the appropriate response when there IS something to be afraid of! Or would you rather people live in ignorance?

                    <br><br>Also, more appropriation of my life: calling Trüí©mp "unstable", after I used the same word to describe one of my coworkers a few days earlier, and "dangerous" from this <a href="/log/2024/08.html#08_14_2024_19_09">post</a>.

                    <br><br>There are literally millions of people in the nation who would qualify for the presidency based on physical and mental ability alone, but you don't see them trying to fill a job position that would affect millions of peoples' lives. 
                    
                    <br><br>Inversely, I would also argue that there are plenty of differently-abled and physically "unfit" people out there who are more competent and would do a much better job than you.

                    <br><br>welp, the perverts have done it again: ran me out of another job by corrupting the workplace through their usual violation and harassment, making it impossible to continue working there

                    <br><br>Perverts set up uggo snake to appear on my computer desktop (where I clock in and do work), so it (taylorsnake) is <a href="/log/2024/06.html#05:38">forced in my peripheral and can't be escaped</a>. Note how this was done on BOTH desktops so that again: I "can't escape" the snake and this form of "rape" and harassment.

                    <br><br>This is in retaliation for posting <a href="https://medium.com/@taylorsnake/snake-of-the-people-d29b79e5a9fa">this</a> hours before coming into work. The snake likes to use this plagiarism specifically to respond to being called out for one of its snakey acts... The snake's line of "logic" TOTALLY makes sense, right? Because in this instance, taylorsnake is the victim when it's going around "showing off the 'billions' of dollars it made from stealing and ripping people off for eras on end", not the people who it stole and ripped off, nor the "literal millions of people living paycheck-to-paycheck and suffering from homelessness and poverty". This is also why, in its old age, taylorsnake remains the pitiful, malicious, self-centered, narcissistic, insecure idiot its always been; because rather than accepting responsibility for the snakey actions it's being called out for and using it to grow and become a better "person" (and I use this term loosely here - as loose as the snake itself üòè), it goes into its default state of victimhood and tries to portray those statements (that called it out for its snakey behavior) as bullying. Also, don't you just love how this idiot invades your privacy and orchestrates these petty little attacks just so you would talk about it? Violating human rights? Welp, as long as it's for a good reason!

                    <br><br>These attacks are also retaliation for some things I said to a friend over the phone the day before about a coworker from this office, üí©ndrea Güí©ll, and her hostility at work. Again, this line of "logic" TOTALLY makes sense, right? My coworkers are COMPLETELY justified in attacking me, by forcing a <a href="/perverts.html#taylorsnake">rapist</a> onto me, after they violate my privacy and did not like that I vented about the hostile work environment they're creating. 
                    
                    <br><br>Also notice how everyone but üí©ndrea, is wearing <a href="/rape_codes.html#silver">#Silver</a>, so that "technically" <i>she's</i> not retaliating. This is also to make me feel that everyone at work is against me and are on üí©ndrea's side. Great üëç. Good for you, üí©digo & Rüí©llin üí©treet Flüí©ts. Glad you guys support someone who's hostile towards other employees and has been committing time theft by having her family members work unapproved overtime for no reason, to the point where you're over budget by 2 years.

                    <br><br>Love how the perverts respond to people calling out Küí©mala's inability to give direct, coherent, and substantive answers on serious questions by editing a hard-hitting interview to at least make it appear as though she does. I guess if you can't make Küí©mala into something she's not, then you can at least trick people into thinking that she is.  Hmm... making someone "at least <i>look[ing]</i> successful"? That seems oddly familiar. Oh yeah: <a href="https://medium.com/@taylorsnake/how-do-you-make-the-public-celebrate-a-mediocre-talentless-plagiarizing-snake-ad044da546b9" target="_blank">that's right</a>.

That's like hiring a chef who can't cook.

                    <br><br>The perverts are just copying and pasting everything they did to force <a href="/perverts.html#taylorsnake">the plagiarizing snake</a> into becoming "mega celebrity" onto Küí©mala so she becomes the leader of the nation.

                    <br><br>...And that new word, "holistic", she learned and repeated "ad nauseam" in a separate interview on 09/26/2024? Yeah, she got that from me as well when I used that very word to answer a question during a <a href="/log/2024/09.html#07:23">job interview</a> a few days prior, on 09/20/2024, at 11:30am.

                    <br><br>Oh and notice how she's wearing <a href="/rape_codes.html#silver">gray</a> and <a href="/log/2024/09.html#19:41">purple</a> more and more now since I started speaking out against her. <a href="/tricks.html#color_conditioning">#ColorConditioning</a>

                    <br><br>Honestly, fü•óck you, pervert. You're an idiot and a disgrace. You make women, people of color, and the Democratic Party look bad. DO BETTER. You're running for the presidency of a nation, not to be a contestant on a reality tv show. <i>(This is why a LIVE interview (or debate) with an unbiased reporter on an uncorrupted platform needs to be had.)</i>

                    <br><br>The perverts made a lying, plagiarizing, thieving, idiotic snake into the "world's biggest celebrity" and now it wants to turn another idiot into becoming the leader of the nation. If that happens, let this be an indication of how far we've regressed as a society.
