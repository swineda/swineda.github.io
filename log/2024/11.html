                    <br><br>How many times has she broken the rules and laws now? And how many times has the <a href="/log/2024/11.html#00:00">media been corrupted</a> in her favor? I guess the rules just don't apply to people in power - what a great precedent to set as the possible new president. Gives you an idea of <a href="/log/2024/10.html#20:27">what it will be like</a> when she's in command üëçüëç 
                    
                    <br><br>...And she wants to claim to be the nominee of the people? Riiiiiiiight.

                    <br><br><i>Let's also just overlook her infidelities and her husband's domestic abuse... because if she were any other candidate, and not the PERVERTS' CANDIDATE, we definitely wouldn't be talking about it either, right?</i>

                    <br><br><a href="/tricks.html#manipulating_media">#MediaManipulation</a>

                    <br><br>PS: HIGHLY doubt that she'll make the uber wealthy "pay their fair share" (much less get any legislation of the sort through congress) when the uber wealthy are the ones corrupting these industries in order to get her elected in the first place! If people doubted that Bernie could get any of his ideas passed, what makes you think Word Salad is going to do any better (an don't forget: she's already been in the WH for 3+ years now!)?

                    <br><br>Don't you love how Küí©mala is trying to portray this all as some kind of petty, drama-filled revenge scheme? Um, yeah... these people and organizations actively conspired and participated in <a href="/log/2024/09.html#21:15">collusion, corruption, and fraud</a> in order to ensure that <a href="/log/2024/10.html#19:00">an unqualified idiot</a> is elected into the office of the presidency, so they can continue corrupting and defrauding our society from the inside out after said idiot is elected:
                    
                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2024/11/01/image2.png">
                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2024/11/01/image3.png">
                    
                    <br><br>This is the same unqualified idiot who, btw, is using the perverts' <a href="/rape_codes.html">rape codes</a> and <a href="/log/2024/10.html#09:12">is violating someone's privacy and copying and reacting to their every move</a> as part of her campaign strategy. 
                    
                    <br><br>Wouldn't you want to hold these people and organizations responsible for those actions? And this is <s>a "former prosecutor"</s> someone who wants to be the next President of the United States we're talking about?

                    <br><br>But then again, this shouldn't come as much of a surprise considering this is inline with everything else that comes out of her mouth:

                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2024/11/01/image4.png">

                    <br><br>As someone who's running for a promotion, OF COURSE you'd want to stop "pointing fingers" so you don't have to accept responsibility for your failures from your current position and people will forget all about those transgressions! That is - until your whole new set of failures once elected to AN EVEN HIGHER POSITION. And in the meantime, it's okay if you continue pointing fingers at your opponent's actions - that's not hypocritical AT ALL!
                    
                    <br><br>Also, definitely continue insisting that people turn the page on "fear" so we all remain living in a state of <a href="/log/2024/10.html#fü•ócking hypocrite">ignorance</a>. (FYI: <s>$6</s> $8 for a gallon of milk is scary; not making enough money to pay rent, utilities, or put away for future financial security is scary; being on the verge of homelessness because of rising inflation and job insecurity is scary. Most of all: HAVING AN INEPT PERVERT AS THE PRESIDENT OF A NATION IS SCARY.)
