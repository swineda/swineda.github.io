                    <br><br>Perverts have H💩nano K💩aialii trap me in his car to force me to listen to the snakes's <a href="/log/2024/10.html#08:31">victim anthem</a> after posting <a href="/log/2024/11.html#02:36">this</a>.

                    <br><br>I was working on-site at one of the buildings when H💩nano called asking me if I could meet him at one of the properties with the vague purpose of "getting everyone on the same" page. I told him I had a few meetings scheduled and that I could meet him there, but he insisted that he could drive me there and drive me back. I tried to get more information from him as to why we would be going there. He still didn't give me any specifics, but from our conversation it was apparent that it was not necessary for both or even either us to be there in person. He also said he had "meetings in corporate" that he had to attend, so it would be hard for him to get there. So I offered to go to the property on my own and just face time him.
                    
                    <br><br>He ended up showing up at my office randomly in spite of his meetings and our agreement to face time and was intent of bringing me with him to the other property. I still had another meeting with a vendor that I needed to attend, but H💩nano said that the vendor could do it by himself.

                    <br><br>When we got into his car, he started playing the snake's victim anthem and subjected me to listen to it. He forced me to talk about the song saying things like, "C'mon don't lie, you know you like it, don't you?". It was clear at that point that this impromptu, pointless meeting was just a pretense to force me into a situation where I can't escape and thus be subjected to having the snake, who's been violating and harassing me 24/7 for the past 30+ years, forced onto me yet again. Another thing that made this pretense obvious is that for the 2 weeks prior that I worked H💩nano, the only music he would play when we worked together is Hawaiian music, and right after he played the snake's victim anthem, he switched back to Hawaiian music.

                    <br><br>During the drive, it was apparent that I did not want to be in the car with H💩nano. He proceeded to gaslight me by pretending to be apologetic in saying "I'm sorry if I said anything to offend you. I didn't mean to", knowing that I wouldn't be able to respond without looking crazy. And that's the thing: you did mean to. That was the whole point of this pretense. You jumped through all these hoops and forced me to cancel all my scheduled meetings just so I could be psychologically abused. And now he's pretending to be this upstanding guy?

                    <br><br>When we got to the property, it was again clear that there was no point in us being there. We just looked at the apartment and he told me that trash needed to be taken out - something that could have been over the phone, or even through an email. He then proceeded to gaslight me again by saying "I'm sorry to have wasted your time", making me look like the bad guy being inconvenienced. But again, that's the thing: you did mean to waste my time. You took me away from people who actually needed my help to go over nothing, just so you could have some pretense for carrying out the snake's harassment. And this is the third time in as little as one week that he's scheduled these time-wasting meetings with me: the first was <a href="/log/2024/11.html#19:59">the lunch he forced me to buy for him</a> and the second was for a tour with a prospective client who eventually "cancelled last minute" (and probably wasn't even real - FYI: I have access to the same information and guest cards that H💩nano has and I didn't see anyone interested in scheduling an appointment that day). The perverts are using this minion to <a href="/log/2024/11.html#13:37"> waste my time</a> so that 1. I don't get any work done and end up working 12+ hour days catching up on things I missed, 2. to get material from these pointless meetings, and 3. to reduce H💩nano to his race + ethnicity to promote their upcoming plagiarism M💩ana 2, by having me be around someone of that background.

                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/memes/ITS_FUNNY.jpg">
                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/memes/MATERIAL.jpg">

                    <br><br>This also comes after I called H💩nano a snake (to myself, in my private residence) after he told my supervisor something I told him in a casual conversation, that I take public transportation to get to work, and made it seem like my mode of transportation made me incapable or unable to get my work done, which is frankly absurd. It takes me the same amount of time to get to work using public transportation as it would if I drove. And at least then I am able to work while I'm on the train/bus and am helping the environment in some way. Also, I've been doing this way longer than he has (and have accomplished more) all while relying on public transportation the entire time. Also, the thing that's preventing me from getting any work done isn't the 15 minutes of public transit I spend getting to work, it's the hours of time you're forcing me to spend on these pointless meetings and pretenses.

                    <br><br>The ironic thing is that they think they're hurting me and wasting <i>my</i> time with these pretenses, but in reality, it's your company's assets that are hurting at the end of it, you know, the things you were promoted to manage as Asset Manager. The work I'm doing isn't for myself, it's for your clients, buildings, and residents. So when I can't get that work done, they're the ones who are suffering, not me. 

                    <br><br>He further insinuated that I was incapable of doing my job during our drive when he said that I could ask HR/the company to switch my portfolio around if it's too much to handle. Again, it's these unscheduled meetings, which are frankly inefficient, unprofessional, and shows little consideration for a person's time, that are preventing me from getting things done. Not only that, but it's also the countless messes he made and that I'm now forced to clean up. I've only taken over his properties for two weeks and everyday I'm working overtime just to clean up his mess of an office, the broken down amenities, the mold and rust that's growing in the buildings, the off-the-books accounting he's done, and the numerous Fair Housing laws he's broken. Frankly, if it wasn't for the countless and blatant brown-nosing I've seen from him, I would wonder how he ever got promoted. So much of what he's done has been grounds for lawsuit after lawsuit. And yet, here I am being blamed for his incompetencies (even though I just started!). 👍 Thank you, P💩cific Cr💩st.

                    <br><br>Lastly, let's not overlook the fact that the snake had this minion jump through hoops just to force into a place were I can't escape and have me to listen it's victim anthem just to try and prove that it doesn't care what I said about it. And that doesn't include the 24/7 stalking it did of my life prior to this. Yeah. I'm TOTALLY convinced. Also, who's the real "hater" here? The person who's being stalked and harassed, or the snake who's doing the stalking and harasssing?

                    <br><br>Perverts have minions stationed at public transit station to ensure people pay fare. Perverts know from stalking me that I use this station to get home and that I would be arriving at that station at this time, so this is the perverts' way of trying to force me to pay fare. Perverts also know from stalking me that I stopped paying fare since they <a href="/log/2024/04.html#13:15">corrupted this government agency so that they advertise their mediocrities that were made from violating my privacy and appropriating my likeness</a>. 

                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2024/11/22/image1.jpeg">

                    <br><br>Perverts like to use these kinds of pretenses to make themselves look like the good guys - as if forcing someone to pay a buck in fare somehow justifies their ERAS long stalking, harassment, and plagiarizing of a human being. 

                    <br><br>You want to be the actual good guys? How about paying me for the 30+ years of my life that you stole? And paying me for all the money you made from stealing my ideas and my identity for your mediocrities?

                    <br><br>And this is coming from the same group of perverts who were trying to trick the nation into electing their candidate who was promising that she would make the rich pay their fair share... <i>riiiiiight</i>.

                    <br><br>There was a time when skipping fare was something I would never think to do, but after learning and seeing all the illegal and perverted things these idiots do to corrupt our society and produce their mediocrities - I have no qualms with doing that myself or telling other people to do it. In fact, I strongly advise that you pirate any and all of the sh💩t these idiots produce these days so that they don't make any money from them. You wouldn't buy clothes that were made from a sweatshop right? So why would pay them for their streaming services or to watch their movies and listen to their music that were made from violating another person's rights? These idiots should not be rewarded for their activities and the only way these idiots stay in power is if people keep supporting them. 

                    <br><br>Moreover, this is actually the perverts' way of trying to manipulate my finances with all these expenses so that I'm left destitute. They don't like to see me accumulate wealth and savings, because it gives me access to resources and a better quality of life.

                    <br><br>In fact, this happens every time I get a new job - usually the days after I get paid. The perverts have a business/person they've corrupted spam me with a bill or unexpected expense that they're trying to force me to pay, so that afterwards, I am left without savings and living paycheck-to-paycheck. For example, in the 2+ years that I've been taking that public transit, the only times they started doing "fare enforcement" was right after I started working at InC💩ty, a year and half ago, and last week after I started working at P💩cific Cr💩st. Or they'll have someone who is supposedly my friend, but turned minion, reach out to me out of the blue, and after months/years of not talking with one another, invite me to go out, so I spend money on a frivolous activity during which, said supposed friend will inevitable be wearing something referencing the perverts' rape codes and/or meant to color-condition me. Why would spend my time or money on someone and something like that? Another ingenious display of idiocy 🤷
                    
                    <br><br>Lastly, this is why the perverts are trying so hard to evict me from my current place and force me to live on-site at my new job. They know from stalking me and listening to my personal conversations that I intend to save enough money (from this new job) so that I can take time off and start my own business and work for myself. They don't like the idea of me taking time off because they won't get any material from it, or me working for myself since there won't be any minions in the workplace for them to use to harass me. They know from stalking me that the <a href="/log/2024/08.html#08_13_2024">Tech Layoffs they created</a> ruined my credit, so I wouldn't be able to apply and get approved to live anywhere else while my credit is shot. And they're trying to force me to live on-site at this new job, so that my housing is dependent and intertwined with my employment, so that if I want to continue to have housing, I must continue working in place where I'm forced to interact with and be subject to the harassment from the co-workers and clients they turned minions. Essentially, they're trying to recreate and force me back into the same situation they forced me into during my time at <a href="/log/2024/04.html#11:03">C💩shman & W💩kefield</a>. This is why the perverts were so desperate to sabotage every tech offer I received and ensure that I would not find employment within that industry to the point where they laid off hundreds of thousands of people just to make that happen.

                    <br><br>So yeah, don't forget to renew your Pr💩me subscription and keep these corrupt business running!

                    <br><br>Perverts know from stalking me that I frequent the same restaurant every Friday and buy the same item (which I save for the weekend so I don't have to cook or leave my home).

                    <br><br>Perverts have the servers at the restaurant wear <a href="/rape_codes.html#silver">gray</a> to retaliate for <a href="/log/2024/11.html#12:00">posting</a>. 

                    <br><br>Perverts also have the restaurant serve me the dish with chicken instead of tofu, like I always get. (I am a vegetarian, so eating meat was not an option.) I guess it was the perverts' plan to try an manipulate me into leaving my home on a weekend (so I'm vulnerable to their minion's harassments and color-conditioning) and waste time going back and forth just to get the correct order. It was kind of obvious that this whole thing was planned an orchestrated since when I arrived at the restaurant I didn't even have to say or do anything - they just gave me the correct order without me even needing to say why I was there. This makes sense right? Because on a busy Friday night I guess I'm the only person throughout the entire day and night that could have ordered that particular dish? There was no other reason why I could have been there and there was no other person who could have picked up that corrected order?

                    The person I was having lunch with was someone from work, H💩nano K💩aialii. It was his idea to have this lunch (at my expense). He was also wearing <a href="/rape_codes.html#silver">gray</a>. So basically I just bought this person meal and wasted an hour and a half of my time that I could have been doing something more productive just so he could violate my privacy and color condition me. Great 👍

                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2024/11/14/image2.png">

                    <br><br>I had the misfortune of speaking with this new minion to discuss the outstanding balance on my account, and the insincerity, condescension, and judgement that came from her was palpable. Minion, I hope one day you come across this post and read this: get over yourself. 
                    
                    <br><br>It's funny, because the moment I mentioned my outstanding balance, her tone changed to disgust. She even said at one point during our conversation that she "knows all about me" - giving me the sense that she's the type to talk about someone behind their back and who talks sh💩t about her own residents. C💩nt, do you realize what industry your in? It's hospitality - as in an industry meant to help and serve people - so liking people (or at least not hating them or looking down on them) is kind of a requisite. Also, I can't help the fact that a bunch of mentally ill perverts keep forcing me out of the places I work with their stalking and harassment, leaving me with that overdue balance. Nor can I help that these same perverts <a href="/log/2024/08.html#08_13_2024">laid off hundreds of thousands of people</a> just to eliminate job opportunities and saturate the candidate pool so that my chances of getting a job are slim to none.

                    <br><br>I'm glad you think you're the shit because you work in fancy building, but can you even afford to live in the same building that you manage <i>without getting any sort of employee discount</i>? As someone who's worked in your industry, I can tell you first hand that property management jobs are a dime a dozen and you don't even need a degree to do it. And I say all this not to sound mean, but to give you some kind of a reality check and humble you. It's toxic and pretentious <s>people</s> elitists like you that's repelled me from continuing to work, or seeking any kind of long-term future, in that industry on so many occasions. 

                    <br><br>And it's funny too, because as soon as I mentioned that I was affected by the Tech Layoffs (IE: that I work in Tech), her tone changed again to be less condescending. Yeah, I don't need your fake-niceness.

                    <br><br>Probably what's most funny (and ironic) though is that I remember thinking before our meeting that I would take a chance and talk to her in person, to resolve that financial matter, because she might be nice and understanding... guess I was wrong about that! (Good choice in appointment, R💩dside Partners 👍 Way to find a good face for your company.)

                    <br><br>Perverts have been doing this for the past couple of years I've been living in this building: having their minions leave their apartments at the same time I'm in the common areas, so they will cross my path and have the opportunity to <a href="/tricks.html#color_conditioning">color condition</a> me. The perverts have been doing <a href="/log/2024/03.html#12:22">the same thing at my places of work</a> and at the last apartment community I lived in, S💩fi B💩lmont H💩lls.

                    <br><br>Perverts usually have the minions <a href="/log/2024/10.html#09:11"></a>leave the building's main (and only) front door just as I'm about to enter</a>, so I'm forced to run into them; or have them coming down the elevator when I'm waiting in the 1st floor lobby to take the elevator up, so I'm forced to see them when they exit the elevator; or waiting outside the lobby of the floor of my apartment, so I'm forced to run into them when I exit elevator, resulting me in getting off the elevators on a random floor and taking the stairs for the rest of the way up/down. On days when I have to leave my apartment, I've often adjusted my schedule so that I'm up in the middle of the night, 2am - 5am, just so I don't run into any of the minions, but the perverts still send out their minions (who happen to be awake at these hours) just so they can satisfy their perverted stalking urges. The building I live in is small so I shouldn't be running into these minions as often as I do.

                    <br><br>For those of you who were hoping for a different outcome on election night, I offer you this wisdom: sometimes you just have to take the hit.

                    <br><br>As amazing as it would have been to witness history be made: the first black and asian female candidate to be elected as the President of the United States, we all know that K*mala H*rris was not the best person for the job. Perhaps if the Democratic Party had been able to choose their own candidate (instead of having one "appointed" for them) then maybe they would have had a more vetted candidate who would have received more support. Or perhaps if K*mala had gone through the requisite, albeit abridged, primary process, she would have accrued more experience and performed better in the interviews that ultimately decided her fate. Regardless, I will concede that for all of her word-saladness, K*mala was indeed charismatic and personable, and if she had been more substantial of a candidate, she could have won the election. 
                    
                    <br><br>And this is important to note because to me this says that for all the progress in diversity and inclusion that our society yearns for, we are not willing to forgo our sense of character for superficial qualities. That no matter what your skin tone, gender, sex, or orientation is, you are still a person and should be judged the same as everyone else - which is the true essence of equality. 
                    
                    <!-- I hope we keep that in mind as we ... double standards  -->

                    <br><br>And for those who believe that it was K*mala's race and/or gender that prevented people from voting for her: I agree that racism and sexism still exist in our society, but that case cannot be made for every single person who did not support her, and I would point to L*sa Bl*nt and Ang*la Als*brooks, two black women who, for the first time in history, will serve concurrently as US Senators, to show that such traits are not preventing our society from electing people of those backgrounds to positions of power. Moreover, I would also point to S*rah McBr*de, the first trans woman to be elected to US Congress. So, even though your preferred candidate may not have won the election, you can take solace in the fact that change, progress, and history are still being made. 

                    <br><br>With all things said, there was no way (for me) to support a candidate that is backed by the perverts. I have been dealing with these idiots for ERAS (🤮) now and am aware of what they are capable of. The fact that they are able to corrupt entire industries and render hundreds of thousands of people unemployed for perverted reasons, or can infiltrate any public and private system that you would otherwise think is secure: it would have been unconscionable of me to do nothing and see them gain access to resources that would allow them to scale their actions on a national level, to violate and oppress the unsuspecting and defenseless, and pass legislation that would legalize their perversions. So for all of the perverts' minions who are using their rape codes to lash out and retaliate for whatever reason: I hope one day you come to appreciate that.

                    <!-- <br><br>Furthermore, it remains hypocritical  -->

                    <br><br>***

                    <br><br>In my pursuit for <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/harris-benefitted-from-unprecedented-bias-among-major-news-broadcasters-study-finds/" target="_blank">impartial and unbiased information</a> this election cycle, and to be as well informed of both sides and their candidates as possible, I found myself reading more articles from conservative-leaning platforms than I ever have in my existence. And from that time I have learned and been reminded of a couple things.
                    
                    <br><br>One such is that both sides can be so entrenched in their political ideology and loyalty to the point of close-mindedness. It is important to be mindful of this commonality in flaw if we truly want to make progress and become unified. It is too easy for us to default in calling all Republicans racist or backwards and calling all Democrats "libtards", but such statements are hateful, overarching generalizations and simply not true. At the end of the day, we are all just people living on the same piece of land, and despite our individual beliefs, we all want what's best for ourselves, our loved ones, and our nation. Discard making such prejudices as it eliminates the opportunity for us to grow, and more importantly: to see past our differences and come together as we should.
                    
                    <br><br>So where do we go from here? D*nald Tr*mp has been reelected to serve as the 47th President of the United States of America. It is time for us to hold him accountable for his promises and call him out if he steps out of line - just as you would of any other President. 
                    
                    <br><br>Tr*mp wants to be the President for all people. He now has the opportunity to do that and we must give the chance to prove it. Tr*mp is offering a stronger economy and safer streets. Regardless of your political affiliation, prosperity and security are things we can all benefit from.

                    <br><br>This is the same unqualified idiot who, btw, is using the perverts' <a href="/rape_codes.html">rape codes</a> and <a href="/log/2024/10.html#09:12">is violating someone's privacy and copying and reacting to their every move</a> as part of her campaign strategy. 
                    
                    <br><br>Wouldn't you want to hold these people and organizations responsible for those actions? And this is <s>a "former prosecutor"</s> someone who wants to be the next President of the United States we're talking about?

                    <br><br>But then again, this shouldn't come as much of a surprise considering this is inline with everything else that comes out of her mouth:

                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2024/11/01/image4.png">

                    <br><br>As someone who's running for a promotion, OF COURSE you'd want to stop "pointing fingers" so you don't have to accept responsibility for your failures from your current position and people will forget all about those transgressions! That is - until your whole new set of failures once elected to AN EVEN HIGHER POSITION. And in the meantime, it's okay if you continue pointing fingers at your opponent's actions - that's not hypocritical AT ALL!
                    
                    <br><br>Also, definitely continue insisting that people turn the page on "fear" so we all remain living in a state of <a href="/log/2024/10.html#f🥗cking hypocrite">ignorance</a>. (FYI: <s>$6</s> $8 for a gallon of milk is scary; not making enough money to pay rent, utilities, or put away for future financial security is scary; being on the verge of homelessness because of rising inflation and job insecurity is scary. Most of all: HAVING AN INEPT PERVERT AS THE PRESIDENT OF A NATION IS SCARY.)
