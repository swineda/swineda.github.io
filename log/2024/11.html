                    <br><br>For those of you who were hoping for a different outcome on election night, I offer you this piece of wisdom: sometimes you just have to take the hit.

                    <br><br>As amazing as it would have been to witness history be made: the first black and asian female candidate to be elected as the President of the United States, we all know that Kamala Harris was not the best person for the job. Perhaps if the Democratic Party had been able to choose their own candidate (instead of having one "appointed" for them) then maybe that candidate would have been more vetted and would have received more support. Or perhaps if Kamala had gone through the requisite, albeit abridged, primary process, she would have accrued more experience and performed better in the interviews that ultimately decided her fate. Regardless, I will concede that for all of her word-saladness, Kamala was indeed charismatic and personable, and if she had been more substantial of a candidate, she may have just won the election. 
                    
                    And this is important to note because to me this says that for all the progress in diversity and inclusion that our society yearns for, we are not willing to forgo our sense of character for superficial qualities. That, no matter what your skin tone, gender, sex, or orientation is, you are still a person and should be judged just as everyone else - which is the true essence of equality. I hope we keep that in mind as we ... double standards 

                    And for those who believe that K
                    I do not ... that prejudices still exist, but I would point to  and, the first , to show that people are 

                   
                    moreover, the first Trans Woman has also been elected to. So, even though your preferred candidate may not have won the election last night, you can take solace in the fact that change, progress, and history are still being made. 

                    ***

                    In my quest for impartial and unbiased information, and to be as well informed of both sides and their candidates as possible, I found myself reading more articles from conservative-leaning platforms than I ever have in my existence. And from that time I have learned and been reminded of a couple things:
                    
                    1) 
                    2) we all want what

                    *** 

                    I have been aware of what the are capable for years now, and have dealt with for ü§Æ - the fact that they are able to disrupt or - it would have been unconscionable of me to do nothing that would give them access to resources to or the ability to . So for all of you m who are using the to retaliate for whatever reason, I hope one day you come to appreciate that.

                    <br><br>How many times has she broken the rules and laws now? And how many times has the <a href="/log/2024/11.html#00:00">media been corrupted</a> in her favor? I guess the rules just don't apply to people in power - what a great precedent to set as the possible new president. Gives you an idea of <a href="/log/2024/10.html#20:27">what it will be like</a> when she's in command üëçüëç 
                    
                    <br><br>...And she wants to claim to be the nominee of the people? Riiiiiiiight.

                    <br><br><i>Let's also just overlook her infidelities and her husband's domestic abuse... because if she were any other candidate, and not the PERVERTS' CANDIDATE, we definitely wouldn't be talking about it either, right?</i>

                    <br><br>PS: HIGHLY doubt that she'll make the uber wealthy "pay their fair share" (much less get any legislation of the sort through Congress & the Senate) when the uber wealthy are the ones corrupting these industries in order to get her elected in the first place! If people doubted that Bernie could get any of his ideas passed, what makes you think Word Salad is going to do any better? (Keep in mind: she's already been in the WH for 3+ years now!)

                    <br><br>Don't you love how Küí©mala is trying to portray this all as some kind of petty, drama-filled revenge scheme? Um, yeah... these people and organizations actively conspired and participated in <a href="/log/2024/09.html#21:15">collusion, corruption, and fraud</a> in order to ensure that <a href="/log/2024/10.html#19:00">an unqualified idiot</a> is elected into the office of the presidency, so they can continue corrupting and defrauding our society from the inside out after said idiot is elected:
                    
                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2024/11/01/image2.png">
                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2024/11/01/image3.png">
                    
                    <br><br>This is the same unqualified idiot who, btw, is using the perverts' <a href="/rape_codes.html">rape codes</a> and <a href="/log/2024/10.html#09:12">is violating someone's privacy and copying and reacting to their every move</a> as part of her campaign strategy. 
                    
                    <br><br>Wouldn't you want to hold these people and organizations responsible for those actions? And this is <s>a "former prosecutor"</s> someone who wants to be the next President of the United States we're talking about?

                    <br><br>But then again, this shouldn't come as much of a surprise considering this is inline with everything else that comes out of her mouth:

                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2024/11/01/image4.png">

                    <br><br>As someone who's running for a promotion, OF COURSE you'd want to stop "pointing fingers" so you don't have to accept responsibility for your failures from your current position and people will forget all about those transgressions! That is - until your whole new set of failures once elected to AN EVEN HIGHER POSITION. And in the meantime, it's okay if you continue pointing fingers at your opponent's actions - that's not hypocritical AT ALL!
                    
                    <br><br>Also, definitely continue insisting that people turn the page on "fear" so we all remain living in a state of <a href="/log/2024/10.html#fü•ócking hypocrite">ignorance</a>. (FYI: <s>$6</s> $8 for a gallon of milk is scary; not making enough money to pay rent, utilities, or put away for future financial security is scary; being on the verge of homelessness because of rising inflation and job insecurity is scary. Most of all: HAVING AN INEPT PERVERT AS THE PRESIDENT OF A NATION IS SCARY.)
