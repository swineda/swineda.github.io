                    <br><br>For those of you who were hoping for a different outcome on election night, I offer you this wisdom: sometimes you just have to take the hit.

                    <br><br>As amazing as it would have been to witness history be made: the first black and asian female candidate to be elected as the President of the United States, we all know that K*mala H*rris was not the best person for the job. Perhaps if the Democratic Party had been able to choose their own candidate (instead of having one "appointed" for them) then maybe they would have had a more vetted candidate who would have received more support. Or perhaps if K*mala had gone through the requisite, albeit abridged, primary process, she would have accrued more experience and performed better in the interviews that ultimately decided her fate. Regardless, I will concede that for all of her word-saladness, K*mala was indeed charismatic and personable, and if she had been more substantial of a candidate, she could have won the election. 
                    
                    <br><br>And this is important to note because to me this says that for all the progress in diversity and inclusion that our society yearns for, we are not willing to forgo our sense of character for superficial qualities. That no matter what your skin tone, gender, sex, or orientation is, you are still a person and should be judged the same as everyone else - which is the true essence of equality. 
                    
                    <!-- I hope we keep that in mind as we ... double standards  -->

                    <br><br>And for those who believe that it was K*mala's race and/or gender that prevented people from voting for her: I agree that racism and sexism still exist in our society, but that case cannot be made for every single person who did not support her, and I would point to L*sa Bl*nt and Ang*la Als*brooks, two black women who, for the first time in history, will serve concurrently as US Senators, to show that such traits are not preventing our society from electing people of those backgrounds to positions of power. Moreover, I would also point to S*rah McBr*de, the first trans woman to be elected to US Congress. So, even though your preferred candidate may not have won the election, you can take solace in the fact that change, progress, and history are still being made. 

                    <br><br>With all things said, there was no way (for me) to support a candidate that is backed by the perverts. I have been dealing with these idiots for ERAS (ü§Æ) now and am aware of what they are capable of. The fact that they are able to corrupt entire industries and render hundreds of thousands of people unemployed for perverted reasons, or can infiltrate any public and private system that you would otherwise think is secure: it would have been unconscionable of me to do nothing and see them gain access to resources that would allow them to scale their actions on a national level, to violate and oppress the unsuspecting and defenseless, and pass legislation that would legalize their perversions. So for all of the perverts' minions who are using their rape codes to lash out and retaliate for whatever reason: I hope one day you come to appreciate that.

                    <!-- <br><br>Furthermore, it remains hypocritical  -->

                    <br><br>***

                    <br><br>In my pursuit for impartial and unbiased information this election cycle, and to be as well informed of both sides and their candidates as possible, I found myself reading more articles from conservative-leaning platforms than I ever have in my existence. And from that time I have learned and been reminded of a couple things.
                    
                    <br><br>One such is that both sides can be so entrenched in their political ideology and loyalty to the point of close-mindedness. It is important to be mindful of this commonality in flaw if we truly want to make progress and become unified. It is too easy for us to default in calling all Republicans racist or backwards and calling all Democrats "libtards", but such statements are hateful, overarching generalizations and simply not true. At the end of the day, we are all just people living on the same piece of land, and despite our individual beliefs, we all want what's best for ourselves, our loved ones, and our nation. Discard making such prejudices as it eliminates the opportunity for us to grow, and more importantly: to see past our differences and come together as we should.
                    
                    <br><br>So where do we go from here? D*nald Tr*mp has been reelected to serve as the 47th President of the United States of America. It is time for us to hold him accountable for his promises and call him out if he steps out of line - just as you would of any other President. 
                    
                    <br><br>Tr*mp wants to be the President for all people. He now has the opportunity to do that and we must give the chance to prove it. Tr*mp is offering a stronger economy and safer streets. Regardless of your political affiliation, prosperity and security are things we can all benefit from.

                    <br><br>How many times has she broken the rules and laws now? And how many times has the <a href="/log/2024/11.html#00:00">media been corrupted</a> in her favor? I guess the rules just don't apply to people in power - what a great precedent to set as the possible new president.

                    <br><br>...And she wants to claim to be the nominee of the people? Riiiiiiiight.

                    <br><br><i>Let's also just overlook her infidelities and her husband's domestic abuse... because if she were any other candidate, and not the PERVERTS' CANDIDATE, we definitely wouldn't be talking about it either, right?</i>

                    <br><br>PS: HIGHLY doubt that she'll make the uber wealthy "pay their fair share" (much less get any legislation of the sort through Congress & the Senate) when the uber wealthy are the ones corrupting these industries in order to get her elected in the first place! If people doubted that Bernie could get any of his ideas passed, what makes you think Word Salad is going to do any better? (Keep in mind: she's already been in the WH for 3+ years now!)

                    <br><br>Don't you love how Küí©mala is trying to portray this all as some kind of petty, drama-filled revenge scheme? Um, yeah... these people and organizations actively conspired and participated in <a href="/log/2024/09.html#21:15">collusion, corruption, and fraud</a> in order to ensure that <a href="/log/2024/10.html#19:00">an unqualified idiot</a> is elected into the office of the presidency, so they can continue corrupting and defrauding our society from the inside out after said idiot is elected:
                    
                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2024/11/01/image2.png">
                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2024/11/01/image3.png">
                    
                    <br><br>This is the same unqualified idiot who, btw, is using the perverts' <a href="/rape_codes.html">rape codes</a> and <a href="/log/2024/10.html#09:12">is violating someone's privacy and copying and reacting to their every move</a> as part of her campaign strategy. 
                    
                    <br><br>Wouldn't you want to hold these people and organizations responsible for those actions? And this is <s>a "former prosecutor"</s> someone who wants to be the next President of the United States we're talking about?

                    <br><br>But then again, this shouldn't come as much of a surprise considering this is inline with everything else that comes out of her mouth:

                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2024/11/01/image4.png">

                    <br><br>As someone who's running for a promotion, OF COURSE you'd want to stop "pointing fingers" so you don't have to accept responsibility for your failures from your current position and people will forget all about those transgressions! That is - until your whole new set of failures once elected to AN EVEN HIGHER POSITION. And in the meantime, it's okay if you continue pointing fingers at your opponent's actions - that's not hypocritical AT ALL!
                    
                    <br><br>Also, definitely continue insisting that people turn the page on "fear" so we all remain living in a state of <a href="/log/2024/10.html#fü•ócking hypocrite">ignorance</a>. (FYI: <s>$6</s> $8 for a gallon of milk is scary; not making enough money to pay rent, utilities, or put away for future financial security is scary; being on the verge of homelessness because of rising inflation and job insecurity is scary. Most of all: HAVING AN INEPT PERVERT AS THE PRESIDENT OF A NATION IS SCARY.)
