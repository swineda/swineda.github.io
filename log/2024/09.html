                    <br><br>Perverts have cleaning/maintenance crew of my building slam their equipment against my front door aggressively after posting <a href="https://medium.com/@taylorsnake/lyrical-genius-e1a4e3fbb3b7" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@taylorsnake/been-seeing-a-lot-of-stitches-of-this-with-woc-absolutely-shredding-taylorsnake-and-the-shit-its-0ed31f8b7ad6" target="_blank">this</a> a few hours earlier.

                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2024/09/03/pic1.png">

                    <br><br>What kind of cleaning requires slamming the vacuum repeatedly against my front door (and only my door), and literally none of the 14 other apartments on my floor? You can only imagine how forceful and aggressively they must be slamming their vacuum if you are able to hear the noise from the other side of the door and over the loud humming of my AC.
                
                    <br><br>Example of the perverts trying to use this threatening and malicious behavior as a scare tactic to try and frighten and "punish" me for speaking out against the <a href="/perverts.html#taylorsnake">thieving idiot.</a>

                    <br><br>TF do these idiots think we are? China? North Korea? They're trying to punish me for speaking out against them so I stop? 

                    <br><br>Also makes you wonder what harm these idiots wish they could inflict upon me if that door wasn't there, and if I didn't have my own home to call a safe space. (Which is probably why the perverts are trying so hard to evict me from said safe space.) Oh wait, you don't have to wonder! The snake has given you ERAS of malicious, coded hate messages in all of its plagiarism as a form of wish fulfillment for what it wish it could do to me (you know: the person without whom it wouldn't have its OBSCENE AMOUNT OF WEALTH)! Be cheated on? Check! Get into a car crash? Check! Catch on fire? Check! <i>... all of which are on top of the barbarism they've already committed: color conditioning, noise campaigns, daily harassment, etc.</i>

                    <br><br>ERAS of hate? Has it really been that long? Makes you want to stop and think about how malicious and ugly you'd have to be to consistently come up with something hateful to say everyday for literal decades about the person you're violating and stealing from; and then how duplicitous and manipulative you'd have to be on top of that, to repackage that hate into something that makes you look like you're the victim, instead of the actual victim: the person you violate and steal from 24/7.
