                    <br><br>This is how STOOOPID and how much of a cüêçnt taylorsnake is. It's M.O. for violating me has primarily been to harass me into doing/saying something that it can copy and use for its plagiarisms, but lately it hasn't been able to get that from me because instead of doing/saying something in response to its harassment, I would instead simply record the harassment in a log (such as what I'm doing on this website).

                    <br><br>So what does taylorsnake do when it can't get material from me? It instead uses the fact that I'm being harassed, or "tortured", for material, and the act of me logging the harassment, as the material itself. ARE YOU REALLY THAT FüêçCKING STUPID AND DESPERATE FOR MATERIAL, IDIOT?
                    
                    <br><br>But are you really surprised that this idiot would use a situation like this - as in: a person being harassed and tortured - for one of its plagiarisms? Of course not. This idiot is a sociopath: it gets enjoyment from trying to inflict pain on me. No moral or mentally healthy person would or could violate someone on a daily basis for ERAS on end; only a mentally ill sociopath is capable of doing something like that. <a href="https://psychcentral.com/health/are-you-an-enabler" target="_blank">Moreover, it gets enjoyment on top of its initial violation and harassment when it sees its plagiarism (that is created from said violation and harassment) being watched, shared, and supported by the public.</a>

                    <br><br>I begin logging a <a href="/log/2024/07.html#08:37">post</a> about how the perverts are setting up interviews for fake companies and job offers just so they can get material from me. Alternatively, if a real company reaches out for a legitimate offer, the perverts will eventually sabotage the situation so I don't get the job; I've attended at least 2 interviews in the past month now wherein the person interviewing me said during the interview that they will hire me only to do the exact opposite and not be heard from again.

                    <br><br>Hours later, the perverts harass me with another spam message for another of these "interviews". Example of perverts using the mimicking/mockery to try and stop me from exposing their harassment.

                    <br><br>Example of how lazy and sloppy these plagiarizing idiots are: that they can't even be bothered to put in enough effort into making the spam message look convincing enough.
                    
                    <br><br>And if you need any more proof of how legit this company is, take a look at its website's domain name history: this company has a whopping TWO months of registration history under its belt.

                    <br><br>Perverts have cleaning/maintenance crew of my building slam their equipment against the front door of my apartment aggressively and repeatedly, under the pretense of cleaning, after posting <a href="https://medium.com/@taylorsnake/lyrical-genius-e1a4e3fbb3b7" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@taylorsnake/been-seeing-a-lot-of-stitches-of-this-with-woc-absolutely-shredding-taylorsnake-and-the-shit-its-0ed31f8b7ad6" target="_blank">this</a> a few hours earlier.

                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2024/09/03/pic1.png">

                    <br><br>What kind of cleaning requires slamming the vacuum repeatedly against my front door (and only my door), and literally none of the 14 other apartments on my floor? You can only imagine how forceful and aggressively they must be slamming their vacuum if I was able to hear the noise from the other side of the door, at the farthest end of the room, and over the loud humming of my AC, while watching a video using noise-cancelling headphones.
                
                    <br><br>Example of the perverts trying to use this threatening and malicious behavior as a scare tactic to try and frighten and "punish" me for speaking out against the <a href="/perverts.html#taylorsnake">thieving idiot.</a>

                    <br><br>TF do these idiots think we are? China? North Korea? They're trying to punish me for speaking out against them so I stop? 

                    <br><br>Also makes you wonder what harm these idiots wish they could inflict upon me if that door wasn't there, and if I didn't have my own home to call a safe space. (Which is probably why the perverts are trying so hard to evict me from said safe space.) Oh wait, you don't have to wonder! The snake has given you ERAS of malicious, coded hate messages in all of its plagiarism as a form of wish fulfillment for what it wish it could do to me (you know: the person without whom it wouldn't have its OBSCENE AMOUNT OF WEALTH)! Be cheated on? Check! Get into a car crash? Check! Catch on fire? Check! <i>... all of which are on top of the barbarism they've already committed: color conditioning, noise campaigns, daily harassment, etc.</i>

                    <br><br>ERAS of hate? Has it really been that long? Makes you want to stop and think about how malicious and ugly you'd have to be to consistently come up with something hateful to say everyday for literal decades about the person you're violating and stealing from; and then how duplicitous and manipulative you'd have to be on top of that, to repackage that hate into something that makes you look like you're the victim, instead of the actual victim: the person you violate and steal from 24/7.

                    <br><br>Cleaning/Maintenance Crew was just on my floor cleaning the hallway a few seconds ago. The perverts are obviously desperate to try and discredit this post by doing their <a href="/tricks.html#opposite_trick">#Opposite</a> trick.

                    <br><br>It's no coincidence that after months of banging on my door, they all of a sudden stop after I write this post. Also, the cleaning crew only cleans once a week, if not every other week, so why are they all of a sudden cleaning twice in the same week?
