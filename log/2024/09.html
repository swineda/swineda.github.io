                    <br><br>Perverts manipulating the media to retaliate/"punish" me (via color conditioning) for what I <a href="/log/2024/09.html#12:19">wrote yesterday</a>  about them tokenizing the female and black communities. Note how they are using a black woman to enact this conditioning; they are reducing her to her gender and race, to "punish" me for calling them out for doing that very thing.

                    <br><br>Or is this message of opposition coming from the person wearing the clothes herself, because she didn't like what I wrote? If so, why are you taking it out on me? <i>I'm</i> not the one who's tokenizing women and the black community. It's the perverts whose rape codes you're wearing who are reducing you to your gender and race! 🤷 Maybe keep that in mind next time you want to participate in their violations.

                    <br><br>You might also want to try and stay impartial the next time you're asked to moderate a debate. If you're going to fact-check and correct one person, then make sure to do that with the other candidate as well. And if you're going to try and force one person to answer your questions, then make sure you force the other candidate to answer their questions as well. And finally, you might want to make sure you don't ask any <i>leading</i> questions at all. <i>Yeah, I get it - Tr💩mp has a lot of things to answer for, but this wasn't the time or place for that! We have a system in place to ensure that due process. If I'm not mistaken, this was supposed to be the stage for a debate, not a court!</i>
                    
                    <br><br>The point of an impartial debate is to allow us to <i>accurately</i> determine which candidate is truly the most capable and thanks to the blatant bias in this one, I have no idea who that is! I can't tell if one person did better than the other because they're a better debater or because one person's questions were easier/harder than other! Nor can I determine who made a more compelling argument if the moderator(s) are leading to think one way or the other! 🤷 It's this type of <a href="/log/2024/08.html#08_14_2024_19_09">manipulation and unfair treatment</a> (from the perverts) that leads us to not having a meritocracy.

                    <br><br>(PS: I also love how so many of what I wrote yesterday (in my unpublished document, on my private computer) was appropriated as talking points in this debate. <i>I can't wait to have a President who's colluding with a bunch of perverts!)</i>
    
                    <br><br>Also an example of the perverts' ambiguity trick, in that one person is wearing <a href="/rape_codes.html#blue">blue</a> and the other is wearing <a href="/rape_codes.html#silver">silver</a>.

                    <br><br>I continue <a href="/log/2024/09.html#08:41">working on the FBI report of that outlines the perverts' illegal activities</a>. This part of the outline details their racist and discriminatory activities. The perverts continue to have <a href="/log/2024/09.html#10:00">have minions slam their doors every try and distract me so I lose my focus/concentration and cannot get any work done</a> (which lasted throughout the entire weekend).

                    <br><br>I move to the bathroom to continue my work, so I am further removed from the noise; the minions' slamming cannot be heard from inside the bathroom. The perverts go ape-sh💩t crazy at the fact that I'm revealing some of their most deplorable acts and cannot use their noise harassment to try and stop me. They try to disrupt my work instead by hacking my computer so that a phone call notification from a spam number appears on my laptop.

                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2024/09/09/image1.png">

                    <br><br>I had the focus setting turned on on both my phone and laptop when this call arrived, so I should not have received this notification. Also, in the 5+ years that I've owned these devices, I have always had the notifications turned off and never did this type of thing happen. The perverts are clearly scared of people knowing their racist and discriminatory activities. 
                    
                    <br><br>The swine did something similar on 03/10/2021, at 9:50pm, where it hacked one of my HomePod speakers to try and communicate with me while I was showering.

                    <br><br>These are examples of the swine's rapist nature, such that it does not take no for an answer, it will not respect my boundaries, it will sexually harass me, and it will find a way of forcing itself and its perversion on me.

What a bunch of idiots. If anything, this once again shows how they use good/social causes as pretenses and tools for their perversions.

                    <br><br>This is how STOOOPID and how much of a c🐍nt taylorsnake is. It's M.O. for violating me has primarily been to harass me into doing/saying something that it can copy and use for its plagiarisms, but lately it hasn't been able to get that from me because instead of doing/saying something in response to its harassment, I would instead simply record the harassment in a log (such as what I'm doing on this website).

                    <br><br>So what does taylorsnake do when it can't get material from me? It instead uses the fact that I'm being harassed, or "tortured", for material, and the act of me logging the harassment, as the material itself. ARE YOU REALLY THAT F🐍CKING STUPID AND DESPERATE FOR MATERIAL, IDIOT?
                    
                    <br><br>But are you really surprised that this idiot would use a situation like this - as in: a person being harassed and tortured - for one of its plagiarisms? Of course not. This idiot is a sociopath: it gets enjoyment from trying to inflict pain on me. No moral or mentally healthy person would or could violate someone on a daily basis for ERAS on end; only a mentally ill sociopath is capable of doing something like that. <a href="https://psychcentral.com/health/are-you-an-enabler" target="_blank">Moreover, it gets enjoyment on top of its initial violation and harassment when it sees its plagiarism (that is created from said violation and harassment) being watched, shared, and supported by the public.</a>

Alternatively, if a real company reaches out for a legitimate offer, the perverts will eventually sabotage the situation so I don't get the job; I've attended at least 2 interviews in the past month now wherein the person interviewing me said during the interview that they will hire me only to do the exact opposite and not be heard from again.

                    <br><br>Hours later, the perverts harass me with another spam message for another of these "interviews". Example of perverts using the mimicking/mockery to try and stop me from exposing their harassment.

Be cheated on? Check! Get into a car crash? Check! Catch on fire? Check! <i>... all of which are on top of the barbarism they've already committed: color conditioning, noise campaigns, daily harassment, etc.</i>

                    <br><br>ERAS of hate? Has it really been that long? Makes you want to stop and think about how malicious and ugly you'd have to be to consistently come up with something hateful to say everyday for literal decades about the person you're violating and stealing from; and then how duplicitous and manipulative you'd have to be on top of that, to repackage that hate into something that makes you look like you're the victim, instead of the actual victim: the person you violate and steal from 24/7.

                    <br><br>Cleaning/Maintenance Crew was just on my floor cleaning the hallway a few seconds ago. The perverts are obviously desperate to try and discredit this post by doing their <a href="/tricks.html#opposite_trick">#Opposite</a> trick.

                    <br><br>It's no coincidence that after months of banging on my door, they all of a sudden stop after I write this post. Also, the cleaning crew only cleans once a week, if not every other week, so why are they all of a sudden cleaning twice in the same week?
