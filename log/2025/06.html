                    <br><br>Get it? Because if you want to play the game and get first place (which is the point of a race) <a href="/log/2025/05.html#23:17">then you have to subject yourself to the perverts' rape codes</a> and wear their stupid hat! <a href="/log/2025/06.html#19:51">Which isn't tacky AT ALL!</a>

This is how swine's mental illness works: its swine-flu addled brain can't handle the fact that winning and first place are universally symbolized by the color <a href="/rape_codes.html#gold">gold</a>, which in their rape language refers to me, so they're trying to make an "opposing" code from said rape language synonymous with winning and first place. (They tried to do the same thing when they corrupted that one olympic swimmer to dye their hair <a href="/rape_codes.html#silver">silver</a> during one of the recent summer games, which subsequently turned a puke-ish color due to the chlorine in the pool ... talk about karma üòè That's what happens when you do these perverts' bidding ü§∑)

                    <br><br>Perverts <a href="/log/2025/05.html#09:09">continue to stalk and psychologically abuse someone who has repeatedly stated in the past that they want to take their life for said perverts' said stalking and psychological abuse</a>. Here, the perverts turn my new residents into minions by making them wear red on their move-in day/their first days as my tenants.

                    <br><br>Here's the first minion:

                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2025/06/03/image1.png">

                    <br><br>We had a meeting scheduled at 1pm. A couple of hours before, I tried to reschedule because of an emergency that came up in one of my other buildings. For some reason she wasn't able to reschedule for later in the day even though she said she cleared her entire day to move; she was only available to pick up keys during a one hour window. In other words, she was not willing to move her schedule around for an EMERGENCY, I had to make <s>my</s> another resident's EMERGENCY work around her. She also gave me a hard time about trying to reschedule for another day. And so I did, and here there they are trying to "punish" me for it. Hey minions: next time, why don't you both paint your entire bodies red because I TOTALLY didn't get the <s>message</s> abuse. What a great way to start your relationship with your new landlord. You realize I'm the person you're going to try to negotiate with, for a lower rent, come renewal, right?

                    <br><br>When we finally met up for her appointment, she ended up canceling the rest of the meeting half-way through because her bathroom sink needed to be replaced.

                    <br><br>I let her know that we're waiting for Maintenance to complete this. Rest-assured, though, this won't stop them from punishing me next time ... for someone else's actions!
                    
                    <br><br>What's funny is during our conversation they mentioned how I was intentionally trying to be dishonest and deceptive; that the emergency I was working on was really her unit, when here they are violating me and openly gaslighting me. Yeah, no. That emergency was in fact at another building ... and I prioritized your move-in over an emergency... just so you could cancel on me.

                    <br><br>The guy in the red shirt isn't even a tenant on the lease, but I like how he's being all chivalrous by wearing red to punish me for doing something "wrong" to his girlfriend. Because I'm such a bad person right? Forget all the work that WAS completed, and the fact that they were all done in spite of the building's debt, for you, even though your paying well below market price. What am I - a slave? Someone you can whip into submission? Hey minions, the next time we see each other, I will be wear something to color condition you. That will be my message to you letting you know that you're both perverts for violating and abusing me.

                    <br><br>Second resident:

                    <br><br>Minion stalking me by sitting outside my building, waiting for me to leave work, to <a href="/tricks.html#color_conditioning">color condition</a> me with <a href="/rape_codes.html#red">red</a>, as a form of "punishment" for not liking the way I said "hi" to him earlier. Yeah. For not liking the way I said "hi". <a href="/log/2025/01.html#12:37">What a great reason to be violated an psychologically abused, right?</a>

                    <br><br>This is what it's been like 24/7 for the past 10+ years. The perverts turn my friends, neighbors, coworkers, or really anyone that I interact with into minions by using them as tools for <a href="/tricks.html#color_conditioning">color conditioning</a>, as a way to try and "punish"/"reward" me (like an animal) primarily for doing things the don't like/like. They secondly use this color conditioning to scrutinize and "punish"/"reward" my interactions with said minions. After stalking and watching me and my interactions with a given minion, they tell that minion to wear some particular color from their rape codes to make it seem like the minion is "punishing"/"rewarding" for something I did in our recent interaction. In this case, the perverts make it seem like the minion didn't like the way I said hi, so they tell the minion to punish me with a color, so that I beat myself up for yet another inconsequential act that had no malicious intent (or any intent/thought at all), to the point where I'm beating myself up for everything, lowering my self-confidence and breaking my spirit, and in the hopes that I will change myself so I get rewarded instead next time. With a color. This is the (nonexistent) quality of life that perverts have been trying to force on me 24/7 for the past 10+ years. Thank you to all you minions who have played a part.
                    
                    <br><br>Literally every second of my life is violated and scrutinized. By perverts. And idiots. It's completely one-sided and a mentally-ill/deluded way for perverts to try and force me into being submissive to everything.

                    <br><br>Again, What kind of üêñüí© are the perverts telling you minions to fool you into <s>participating</s> being accessories to this human rights violations? They're tricking you into thinking that there's a good reason to violate someone's privacy and rights (I can't even finish typing that without thinking of how stupid a statement that is), but there isn't. You're not undercover FBI agents tracking a terrorist or a superhero taking down some bad guy. Your being duped into acting as perverted, illegally, and unethically, as the perverts the perverts to attack someone defenseless. Congrats. 

                    <br><br>Also, just to give you all some context: I was rushing to make an appointment with another person, which is why I didn't have time to give a good enough greeting (because apparently I'm some kind of trained seal to these minions) - that and this minion has been color conditioning for the past 6 months that I've been working at the place.

                    <br><br>Perverts are once again trying to <a href="/log/2025/04.html#13:23">dictate</a> what your <a href="/rape_codes.html#summer">summer</a> is going to be, and are trying to trick you into following another one of their manufactured, <a href="/rape_codes.html">rape-coded</a> trends, by getting you to wear and make hot pink a thing. 

                    <br><br>Perverts are also once again <a href="/log/2025/02.html#10:19">desperately trying to find codes that I haven't yet logged/recorded yet on this site and are therefor unaware to the public and unrecognizable to the unsuspecting, to use in their harassments</a>; this time with <a href="/rape_codes.html#remember">"memories"</a>. Hey, you perverted idiots: one day all of your rape codes will be documented, and all people will have to do is go back these past 10 years to see that they were forced into everything.

                    <br><br>This is another another example of the perverts making <a href="/log/2025/03.html#00:35">the fashion industry look bad by forcing adverts that are superficial and have no sense or depth</a>, and that <a href="/log/2025/02.html#10:19">insult your intelligence - the fact that these perverts think they can get away with perverse and corrupt acts by simply covering it up with some half-üêñssed slop</a>. First of all, you're trying to make hot pink a thing and yet NOTHING in this ad is that color? Second, what does "making memories since whatever" have to do with a "hot pink" summer? You're talking about a current/upcoming fashion season and yet trying to call back to the past, even though that past, in part or as a whole, has nothing to do with the current trend you're trying to force to become a thing. Why? The purpose of forcing that line onto this advert was simply to add another layer of gaslighting. This is the perverts doing whatever the füêñck they want to an advert just because they're able to corrupt it, in the hopes that the person they've been stalking 24/7 for X-decades might somehow pass it by and see it, then fall victim to their psychological abuse.

                    <br><br>This is what the perverts do when they shüêñt all over everything in our society. Do you think they care about the movies and tv shows you watch? The music you listen to? The (lore of the) video games you play, the designs that you wear and place in your home? NO üôÖ They don't give a shüêñt about the IP's the you love and that give you a sense of escapism and belonging. Do you think they're corrupting these industries so they can make them better? NO üôÖ. They just care about forcing their stupid nonsense rape codes and delusions into everything they can. It's ritual in their cult. They literally cannot let something go by without forcing their rape codes into it.  It's their mental illness. 

                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/memes/SWINE_CANT_STOP.jpg">
                    
                    <br><br>To all of you gamers, tv, and movie lovers: you think it's a coincidence that all of a sudden everything started to suck around 2015 - the same time the perverts started corrupting everything - and that the quality of storytelling dropped significantly since then? When watching one of your movies, shows, and especially revivals, how many times have you noticed that something didn't make sense in the established lore of a respective universe? Like how C*ptain Am*rica was <a href="/rape_codes.html#dance">dancing</a> with someone he shouldn't have in Avüí©ngers üêçnd Güêçme (not to mention the fact that <a href="/perverts.html#taylorsnake">the snake<a> forced that movie to be titled after one of its plagiarisms, so it can piggy back off another big entity's fame through association/subliminal manipulation), or how <a href="/rape_codes.html#dance">Z-müêçves</a> were random as füêçck and made no sense at all in those Püí©kemon game set in <a href="/rape_codes.html#hawaii">Hawaii</a>, in between three installments that were set in Europe? Since 2015, how many times have you thought or said this about one of your beloved IPs: "... but then they ruined [insert IP here]"? 
                    
                    <br><br>To all of you designers and artists: you think it's a coincidence that all of sudden NOTHING in the fashion industry made sense since 2015, and the trends that were <s>coming out</s> being forced were random AF? Yeah, it's not a coincidence. Just flip through any book chronicling a designer's work through the ages and you'll notice that the pieces coming out around and after 2015 are always glaringly out of place from their previous works. 
                    
                    <br><br>Even the most sophisticated algorithms can't make sense of any of the shüí©t that's been forced to be a thing since 2015, because none of them MAKES ANY SENSE. There's no <a href="/log/2025/03.html#00:35">deeper meaning</a> or theme behind any of this shüí©t - gosh no! That would require the perverts to actually do work and stop stealing peoples' identities!
