                    <br><br>Hey Karen the Hutt - the next time you feel the need to put my job at risk over a couple of cabinet doors, you might want to keep this in mind: the people who you're complaining to about me told me to deny your application over your bad credit, but I fought for you and told them to give you a chance. So thank you SO much for returning that kindness. 👍

                    <br><br>And for the other minions who live in this building: if you find yourself wondering why we're not repainting the walls and replacing the carpets, lights, and furniture in hallways, or doing any of the other projects I had planned to make your qualities of life nicer, it's because all of the money went to this one greedy, self-centered, over-dramatic minion. Don't forget to thank her when you see her in the hallways. 👏

                    <br><br>Oh, and let's not overlook the swine and snake's role in this as well: it's really the perverts' fault for making these minions see me as some kind of personal servant/slave, who they can treat poorly and attack and harass (with the <a href="/rape_codes.html">rape codes</a>) anytime they don't get what they want, and <i>until</i> they get what they want - even if it's at the expense of others and the business itself. 🤷 
                    
                    <br><br>Isn't this the best job and life ever? Who WOULDN'T want to <s>take their life</s> live this kind of life and work this job? This is why the perverts sh🐖tted all over the T*ch Industry and displaced hundreds of thousands of people in the process: so I could deal with this inane b🐍llsh🐖t and harassment all day, and perverts can get material in the process, instead of me doing something more substantial and personally enjoyable, and in a high-paying job, that I would have eventually save enough money from to never work and give these idiots material ever again.

                    <br><br>Notice how she tries to <a href="/tricks.html#turning">"flip the script"</a> by trying to use my own words against me, for her own self-service. In my story, I wrote that the villain is trying to make a sw🐍ft getaway (after committing crimes and defrauding a bunch of innocent people):

                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2025/05/01/image3.png">
                    
                    <br><br>And in K💩mala's "speech", she describes Tr*mp as a <a href="https://thespectator.com/topic/kamala-harris-back-emerge-speech/" target="_blank">"vessel for the sw🐍ft implementation of an agenda that has been decades in the making"</a> ... WTF DOES THAT EVEN MEAN???? I know your intent was to try to sound smart and deep and wise, but no. Just no. It's not happening. This is the same sh💩t the sn🐍ke and sw🐖ne do with their plagiarisms. So I will ask you the same thing: <a href="/log/2025/03.html#00:35">"how can you pretend to be deep and know anything about life when your "identity" (or lack thereof) is a collective plagiarism of others'?"</a>

                    <br><br>Once again, I will politely ask you to PLEASE F🥗CK OFF. Please STOP copying me and do not try to pervert my words. My story wasn't about the Tr*mp administration; it was about YOU and the PERVERTS who corrupted (and continue to corrupt) the news media, the print media, and everything else we interact with, so they can <a href="https://medium.com/@taylorsnake/hey-taylorsnake-whats-a-filibuster-cdc398aff25c" target="_blank">trick the people into voting one of their appointed minion cultists</a> into the Wh*te H*use and have some kind of power over the nation, its laws, and our ways of life. (FYI: If it wasn't obvious, the "sw🐍ft getaway" refers to <a href="/perverts.html#taylorsnake">taylorsnake</a>. Actually, this is obvious to the perverts and is their attempt at trying to <a href="/tricks.html#turning">"turn"</a> my own words against me, as a way trying to psychologically abusive me. Such "L🐍VERSSSSSSSS", right?)

                    <br><br>It's really for your own good (that you stop violating me), because this is the kind of perverted bullshit that calls into question your authenticity and integrity. (Isn't it absurd how I have to use the perverts' own self-interests to persuade them to stop hurting another person?) Whose lives did you say matter? Certainly not mine by the way you and your perverts violate and harass my rights 24/7 for the X-decades of my existence. Or are these acts okay because you're black, or because you're a woman? With the perverts backwards and perverted ideology or race and feminism, I can't help but wonder that if I were black and/or a woman, that people would be more affronted by the human rights violations consistently inflicted on me.
                    
                    <br><br>Tell me, why is that when you were running for President, you only created an agenda to help the black, male population AFTER the media started reporting you were down in numbers with that constituency? Why wasn't that agenda never part of your original platform? Were you just pandering to minorities to get votes? Would that have been okay if you were white and/or a man? Moreover, why was there no agenda for Indian people, Native-American people, Asian people, Middle Eastern people? If you insist on talking about sex, gender, and race theory? Well, these are the types of CRITICAL-THINKING questions you have to answer.  
                    
                    <br><br>Also, why is it that your platform is STILL centered on Tr*mp? Can't you stand on your own <i>merit</i>?

                    <br><br><a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/06/26/kamala-harris-poll-2024-election-biden" target="_blank">N💩C News poll: K💩mala H💩rris hits record low for VP net favorability</a>

                    <br><br>Oh... I guess you can't 🤷
                    
                    <br><br>What I also DON'T understand is this illogical notion where people think that K💩mala would have all of a sudden been a better Pr*sident just because the perverts are forcing this narrative of D*nald Tr*mp doing a "bad" job and having bad approval ratings during his first 100 days. 

                    <br><br>First of all, this narrative is coming from <a href="https://townhall.com/columnists/kurtschlichter/2025/04/30/dont-believe-the-anti-hype-n2656207" target="_blank">"the same people who have lied to you about literally everything for the last decade"</a>, and who <a href="https://chroniclesmagazine.org/web/the-medias-fake-narrative-on-trumps-first-100-days/" target="_blank">"told us B[*]den was “sharp as a tack” until just hours before the former president withdrew from the 2024 race [...] and denied the authenticity of H[*]nter B[*]den’s laptop and later, after its authenticity was established in court, dismissed concerns about him receiving a sweeping presidential pardon from his father."</a>
                    
                    <br><br>But for argument's sake, let's say D*nald Tr*mp was doing a bad job and did have bad approval ratings. How does that all of a sudden make K💩mala a good candidate? Don't you think that maybe, <i>just maybe</i>, K💩mala would have done just as "bad" a job, if not worse, had she been elected? We saw how she was as V💩ce Pr💩sident, so you can only image what she would have been like as Pr💩sident.

                    <br><br>If this seems oddly familiar to you, it should. <a href="/log/2024/10.html#19:00">The perverts are just copying and pasting another one of their old tricks; this is the one that they use with the snake's PR deceptions.</a> Recall how whenever K*m, K*nye, H*rry, C*lvin, K*ty, etc. (you know snake's loooong list victims) receives bad publicity, it is somehow used to make the snake look better by comparison, as if the snake isn't it's own separate <s>being</s> thing that can't stand on it's own merits, or rather: lack thereof. (What was that hypocritical garbage the snake was spewing about not pitting itself against other people? ...Or does that only apply to <s>women</s> itself?)

                    <br><br>Here again is another ingenious display of idiocy, because when K💩mala does this, it calls into question her authenticity and integrity. Where does your "joy" come from exactly? What is this "joy" you're asking other people to take part in? Putting down D*nald Tr*mp? Making personal attacks and calling him and his staff "weird"? Isn't that just bullying? Does is that okay because it's coming from you, a woman of color, and because it's directed at white men? 

                    <br><br>All in all, this is just the perverts way of trying to manipulate the population's emotions, by regretting voting for Tr*mp, and priming you all into voting for another one of the perverts' appointed candidates come next election cycle. Why else are all the <s>legacy media</s> known corrupted outlets focusing on the 2028 elections when it's still 2025 and Donald Trump is only in his first 100 days in office? Dude, that's still THREE/FOUR YEARS away.

                    <br><br>Why? Because these perverts' fragile egos can't handle the fact that they lost and they no longer have puppets in the Wh*te H*use, who they can pervert.

                    <br><br>And again, this is a <a href="/log/2025/05.html#More-Downfalls-of-a-Party">tragedy for anyone who really believes and supports the Democratic ideals</a>. Isn't it a shame when these perverts use <a href="/tricks.html#CausesAsPretenses">good causes as pretenses</a> for their perversions? This is what happens when you let them fester in our society and give them attention instead of canceling and blocking them on all platforms.
