                    <br><br>Apparently <a href="/minions.html#zYequi">this minion</a> likes to get people fired - on top of <a href="/log/2025/04.html#11:47">violating their privacy and gaslighting them</a>, that is.

                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2025/05/06/image1.png">

                    <br><br>Hey Karen the Hutt - the next time you feel the need to put my job at risk over a couple of cabinet doors, you might want to keep this in mind: the people who you're complaining to about me told me to deny your application over your bad credit, but I fought for you and told them to give you a chance. So thank you SO much for returning that kindness. 👍

                    <br><br>And for the other minions who live in this building: if you end up wondering why we don't have the money to repaint the walls and replace the carpets, lights, and furniture in hallways, or do any of the other projects I had planned to make your qualities of life nicer, it's because all of the money went to this one greedy, self-centered, over-dramatic minion. Don't forget to thank her when you see her in the hallways. 👏

                    <br><br>Oh, and let's not overlook the swine and snake's role in this as well: it's really the perverts' fault for making these minions see me as some kind of personal servant/slave, who they can treat poorly and attack and harass (with the <a href="/rape_codes.html">rape codes</a>) anytime they don't get what they want, and <i>until</i> they get what they want - even if it's at the expense of others and the business itself. 🤷 
                    
                    <br><br>Isn't this the best job and life ever? Who WOULDN'T want to <s>take their life</s> live this kind of life and work this job? This is why the perverts sh🐖tted all over the T*ch Industry and displaced hundreds of thousands of people in the process: so I could deal with this inane b🐍llsh🐖t and harassment all day, and perverts can get material in the process, instead of me doing something more substantial and personally enjoyable, and in a high-paying job, that I would have eventually save enough money from to never work and give these idiots material ever again.
