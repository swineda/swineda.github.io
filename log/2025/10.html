                    <br><br>Wow! Another <a href="https://medium.com/@taylorsnake/hmm-where-have-we-seen-this-before-8baed150abb2" target="_blank">PR marriage</a> AND a new plagiarism?? Things must be BAD at the snake's hole if it's <s>pulling out</s> REUSING all of its tired PR tricks to salvage its garbage PR image.

                    <br><br>But this should come as no surprise to anyone that the snake is desperately trying to bury the truth about it yet again, after all of the comeuppances the snake has been through this past year alone - what with the <a href="https://medium.com/@taylorsnake/finally-something-all-sides-can-agree-on-cfab7a43a1f9" target="_blank">President calling it out</a>, the perverts' <a href="https://medium.com/@taylorsnake/hey-taylorsnake-whats-a-filibuster-cdc398aff25c" target="_blank">delusion of it being "tHe BiGgesT CelEbriTy In tHE WorLD" being shattered</a>, and people <a href="https://medium.com/@taylorsnake/or-rather-mad-snake-disease-3d069d7e44bc" target="_blank">booing its uggo üêçss out of a football stadium</a> - to name a few.

                    <br><br>@Media: don't forget to feed into the snake's tricks and give it all the attention and coverage it so desperately wants! Yes, let's feed into the trick of turning this uneducated, unartistic, plagiarizing, basic, pariah of the early aughts into "tHe BiGgesT CelEbriTy In tHE WorLD" - IE: the <a href="/log/2024/10.html#19:00" target="_blank">same tricks</a> that the perverts used to turn Kü•óamala from the <a href="/log/2025/05.html#why-are-you-still-copying-me?" target="_blank">worst VP in history</a> to the savior of all of society's problems (that it helped create). Don't forget: that's how you ended up being so <a href="https://medium.com/@taylorsnake/and-you-wonder-why-theres-such-a-distrust-of-the-media-and-press-these-days-82a0c65d4901" target="_blank">distrusted by the people</a> in the first place! Let's not learn from our history and keep repeating the past!

                    <br><br>Güêçddamn, snake! Can't you unleash one of your plagiarisms WITHOUT using any of your rape codes? <a href="/rape_codes.html#pink">#pink</a> <a href="/rape_codes.html#gold">#gold</a>. Oh wait. I forgot: that's not allowed in your cult. ü§∑

                    <br><br>Also: wow @T*rget! First you <a href="/log/2025/08.html#23:54" target="_blank">plagiarize my ideas</a>, then you promote a plagiarist! I'm sensing a pattern here... Maybe those people were right in boycotting/canceling your store ü§∑

                    <br><br>***

                    <br><br>And now... the moment you've been waiting for: the reviews are in! And like taylorsanke ... they're <a href="https://medium.com/@taylorsnake/when-you-delude-yourself-into-thinking-youre-a-model-who-can-pull-off-any-look-like-the-actual-acb6576f0b86" target="_blank">not pretty</a>:

                    <br><br><i>BTW: that teeth thing that the snake is doing that's making you want to vomit? Yeah, it's copying something I did at my friend, James' party a about month ago (except when I did it, it was cute ü§≠).  Good to know that the snake has no problem invading the privacy of other people's homes. (Yeah, if you think these perverts are just violating my rights, think again)</i>
