                    <br><br>Perverts hire one of its minions to steal a new $3000 laptop I purchased online, from my building's mail area, as soon as it got delivered and before I could pick it up.

                    <br><br>The perverts get off on trying to keep things that I like/love/want/need away from me. This mentally-ill behavior of theirs was so enabled after almost a decade of trying to keep me and Hugh apart that it now manifests in incidents like this.

                    <br><br>They also have this compulsion and obsession of trying to keep me destitute. The idea of me being financially stable and accumulating wealth is so harmful and offensive to their fragile ego(s), because to them, I am some kind of worker slave that exists  to give them material and ideas to steal (yes, that's right: the same perverts who came up with DEI and preach BLM 😏) that they try to do anything they can to prevent me from getting a high-paying job, like laying off hundreds of thousands of people in the tech-industry, just so I can't get work in that field; or getting companies to rescind the job offers I do get, a day or so after I get them. Aside: remember when those Tech companies started firing people <a href="/log/2025/10.html#12:00">at the same time</a> and said it was because they "over-hired" during the pandemic, and now here they are hiring for those same jobs at half the salaries?

                    <br><br>Interesting how these minions are always around to steal my packages at the the exact times they're scheduled to be be delivered (and when I'm not around to pick them up) - almost as if I'm being stalked 24/7 and the perverts are accessing my personal information without consent!

                    <br><br>Wow! Another <a href="https://medium.com/@taylorsnake/hmm-where-have-we-seen-this-before-8baed150abb2" target="_blank">PR marriage</a> AND a new plagiarism?? Things must be BAD at the snake's hole if it's <s>pulling out</s> REUSING all of its tired PR tricks to salvage its garbage PR image.

                    <br><br>But this should come as no surprise to anyone that the snake is desperately trying to bury the truth about it yet again, after all of the comeuppances the snake has been through this past year alone - what with the <a href="https://medium.com/@taylorsnake/finally-something-all-sides-can-agree-on-cfab7a43a1f9" target="_blank">President calling it out</a>, the perverts' <a href="https://medium.com/@taylorsnake/hey-taylorsnake-whats-a-filibuster-cdc398aff25c" target="_blank">delusion of it being "tHe BiGgesT CelEbriTy In tHE WorLD" being shattered</a>, and people <a href="https://medium.com/@taylorsnake/or-rather-mad-snake-disease-3d069d7e44bc" target="_blank">booing its uggo 🐍ss out of a football stadium</a> - to name a few.

                    <br><br>@Media: don't forget to feed into the snake's tricks and give it all the attention and coverage it so desperately wants! Yes, let's feed into the trick of turning this uneducated, unartistic, plagiarizing, basic, pariah of the early aughts into "tHe BiGgesT CelEbriTy In tHE WorLD" - IE: the <a href="/log/2024/10.html#19:00" target="_blank">same tricks</a> that the perverts used to turn K🥗amala from the <a href="/log/2025/05.html#why-are-you-still-copying-me?" target="_blank">worst VP in history</a> to the savior of all of society's problems (that it helped create). Don't forget: that's how you ended up being so <a href="https://medium.com/@taylorsnake/and-you-wonder-why-theres-such-a-distrust-of-the-media-and-press-these-days-82a0c65d4901" target="_blank">distrusted by the people</a> in the first place! Let's not learn from our history and keep repeating the past!

                    <br><br>G🐍ddamn, snake! Can't you unleash one of your plagiarisms WITHOUT using any of your rape codes? <a href="/rape_codes.html#pink">#pink</a> <a href="/rape_codes.html#gold">#gold</a>. Oh wait. I forgot: that's not allowed in your cult. 🤷

                    <br><br>Also: wow @T*rget! First you <a href="/log/2025/08.html#23:54" target="_blank">plagiarize my ideas</a>, then you promote a plagiarist! I'm sensing a pattern here... Maybe those people were right in boycotting/canceling your store 🤷

                    <br><br>And now... the moment you've been waiting for: the reviews are in!

                    <br><br><i>BTW: that teeth thing that the snake is doing that's making you want to vomit? Yeah, it's copying something I did at my friend, James' party a about month ago (except when I did it, it was cute 🤭m).  Good to know that the snake has no problem invading the privacy of other people's homes. (Yeah, if you think these perverts are just violating my rights, think again)</i>
