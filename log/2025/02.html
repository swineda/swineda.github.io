                    <br><br>It's crazy to me how you minions fall for anything that the perverts put on the internet so long as it's slightly meme-ish or has some kind of name that sounds slightly <s>intellectual</s> pretentious. I mean look at you who have participated in the violation my privacy throughout the years. The fact that you can be so easily tricked into violating another human being's privacy and participate in their suffering so long as it's on the internet and presented like a tv show is just baffling and deplorable. How many of you minions say you fight for X-rights or say that so-and-so lives matter and yet here you are demonstrating the exact opposite of those supposed virtues? Do you tell yourself that it's somehow okay to watch someone's violation of privacy just because you didn't capture the footage yourself? Yeah, no. Try applying that logic to child pornography.
                    
                    <br><br>We often talk about dystopian societies and our fear of turning into one, but the thing is: we’re kind of already there 🤷 What’s more dystopian than a society who has all this information about you and knows everything about you: what you like, what you don’t like, and how you think, and uses that information to manipulate you into thinking, liking, disliking what it wants. 
                    
                    <br><br>The perverts have been telling you what trends to like, what movies and shows to watch, what music to listen to, what clothes to wear, what colors to like, what words are <a href="/rape_codes.html#fire">"lit"</a> 🤮. And you minions fall for it every time ! ... for the past 10+ years ! 🤷 
                    
                    <br><br>Keep drinking the K🐖🐍l-Aid, minions. Keep these corrupt perverts in our society. You'll thank them for it when your standard of living degrades to the point where you're not able to afford anything and the only people who own anything are the ones corrupting the society you live in.

                    <br><br>This is after the perverts stalked me and saw me order regularly from this establishment for the past 4+ months:

                    <br><br>The perverts used the same trick multiple times with the iPh💩ne when one of the colors of the phone had the same name circa 2020 around the time <a href="/corruptions.html#SunAndMoon">P💩kémon S💩n & M💩💩n</a> and <s>their sequel games</s> the swine's sequel delusions <s>released</s> plagued our society, and again circa 2022 when the snake plagued society with another one of its plagiarism of the same name. Example of the perverts undermining our economy and conspiring to ensure the commercial successes of certain items through subversive, subliminal, and perverted means. And by certain items, I mean only items that reference their <a href="/rape_codes.html">rape codes</a> and <a href="/delusions.html">delusions</a> (... because apparently they can't achieve the same kind of "success" honestly and <i>without</i> corrupt means.) 
                    
                    <br><br>Also apparent: this is what it takes to be the snake of the year... <a href="https://medium.com/@taylorsnake/and-you-wonder-why-theres-such-a-distrust-of-the-media-and-press-these-days-82a0c65d4901" target="_blank"> according to certain publications</a>. Kids: make sure to behave as dishonestly as this snake, so that one day you can make a vanity project for yourself and payola your way onto the cover of a magazine! Aren't you proud of the society we live in today? 👏👏👏


                    <br><br>Also note how the perverts are using <a href="/log/2024/10.html#19:00">their trick of trying to make something look popular, when it really isn't, in the hopes of tricking people into mindlessly jumping on a bandwagon that never actually existed</a>

                    <br><br>The perverts <a href="/log/2024/04.html#13:15">corrupting bus advertisements again</a>. 
                    
                    <br><br>This is after stalking me to know that I take public transportation regularly to get to an from work. They intentionally place these <a href="/rape_codes.html">coded</a> forms of harassment in places they know I will see, effectively "forcing" me to be harassed; I cannot get to and from work without being harassed. This is an example of the perverts' "rapist" natures. 

                    <br><br>The is also after I acknowledged the last time <a href="/log/2024/04.html#13:15">the swine corrupted the same bus adverts to publicize its plagiarized slop</a>. After I acknowledged its harassment, it knew it was an effective way to make contact with me and could repeat it, which it has here.

                    <br><br>Note how the perverts are desperately trying to find codes that I haven't yet logged/recorded yet on this site and are therefor unaware to the public and unrecognizable to the unsuspecting, to use in their harassments, which in this case is <a href="/log/2018/12.html#21:06">birds</a>. This is because it's important to the fugly swine to have a kind "secret" 1-on-1 relationship with the person it's stalking/harassing; it deludes itself into thinking that this "secret relationship" (it's having with itself) as a form of <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/stalkers-and-their-victims/intimacy-seeker-and-the-incompetent-suitor/ED5084564C701CA8D71D667ADEB403AE" target="_blank">intimacy</a> and gets off on it. If people know about these codes, then it can't send secret coded messages to the person it's stalking! 🤷

                    <br><br>Using unrecorded codes also allows the perverts to continue gaslighting me and making me look crazy. (The snake in particular gets off on making me look crazy and having people think that I am, and then using that false perception to make itself look, by comparison, like some kind innocent girl that's being bullied by a person (usually men and people of color - EG: K*nye, H*rry St*les, C*lvin H*rris, you know the loooooong list). But in reality, it's not an innocent girl, or anything remotely close; it is a malicious, middled aged, STD-ridden-and-spreading snake. Why does it get enjoyment from all of this? I don't care to know the inner-workings of its diseased and prepubescent mind, but I can only guess it's because it's just THAT much of a "l🐍ver"!) 
                    
                    <br><br>Get it? Because to the unsuspecting, it would look like I'm taking random pictures of, and getting pissed off at, bus advertisements. But in reality, the perverts are the mentally ill ones for stalking a person for 10+ years, going back to a code they created from said stalking, forcing that code on a bus line they know that person takes, and then waiting for that person's ...
                    
                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/memes/REACTION.jpg">
                    
                    <br><br>to said code!

                    <br><br>Probably the most pathetic part of all this is how the perverts think they're being all clever! and witty! because they're being punny! and using words that they heard youths saying, like "boop"! But in reality, the adverts are just tacky and make no sense. You want us to be careful of birds, not people? Why? Are birds the ones that use crosswalks? And why is it just birds specifically? If a bus is coming toward a bird, it will just fly way! Doesn't it make more sense to use a non-winged animal ... or IDK: an actual human being? This is type of thing that should insult your intelligence - the fact that these perverts think they can get away with perverse and corrupt acts by simply covering it up with some half-🐖ssed slop.

                    <br><br>Also note how the ads use the perverts' <a href="/rape_codes.html#ambiguity">#ambiguity</a> trick. In the winter adverts, it's a <a href="/rape_codes.html#birds">bird</a>, but it's <a href="/rape_codes.html#bw">black and white</a>! And in the crosswalk adverts, there are <a href="/rape_codes.html#birds">birds</a>, but backgrounds are <a href="/rape_codes.html#blue">blue</a>, which they eventually turned purple, because in other words - oh hey! another trick: they <a href="/tricks.html#utrning">turned</a> it <a href="/rape_codes.html#red">red</a>! This is how deep these perverts are into their own delusions, that they would go into this much depth and detail into forcing every rape code and trick into bus advert, which they force their stalkee to see. Again, using these rape codes makes the swine feel close and intimate with the person it's stalking. 

                    <br><br>It's times like these where I want to thank the city for their continued part in all of this harassment and human rights violations. When I moved here two years ago, I was so excited because I thought I would be moving to a welcoming, open-minded, inclusive, and progressive city, that prided itself on fighting for the little guy, and fighting against big business, and yet, here it is doing the exact opposite that. Who knew it would be that easy for the city government to be corrupted 🤷
