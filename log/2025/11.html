                    <br><br>Note how the pervert sloppily and lazily repeats this perversion in particular; it's trying to force its mentally-ill harassment on me on a place it knows I interact with on a regular basis; it also likes to repeat things that it thinks people don't believe are happening because it gets off on the gaslighting.

                    <br><br>Interesting how it can so easily corrupt g*vernment organizations... almost makes you want to make sure it stays as far away from any government official/position/agency as possible.
