                    <br><br>This is sad to say, but in retrospect this doesn't even surprise me me anymore, considering all the <a href="/log/2024/09.html#21:15">corruption and fraud from this most recent election</a> and <a href="https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2025/03/31/revealed_pro-kamala_social-media_millions_that_couldnt_make_brat_rhyme_with_democrat_1100324.html" target="_blank">all the information that's been released about it</a> (and the past administration) since then.

                    <br><br>It was just before the pandemic when I started calling <a href="/perverts.html#swineda">the swine</a> "swine flu", after all the perverted acts it committed against me, and for corrupting other people and companies to do the same (IE: it's spreading its diseased acts around our society):

                    <br><br><a href="/log/2019/01.html#15:53">Link</a>
                    <br><br><a href="/log/2019/11.html#21:06">Link</a>

                    <br><br>And now, I'm assuming this was the swine's way of trying to <a href="/tricks.html#ambiguity">"flip the script"</a> and throw that insult back at me by trying to gaslight people into thinking <a href="/rape_codes.html#vampires">bats</a> were the cause of Covid-19. I mean, really. 

                    <br><br>And if I think about it, the timing of the pandemic itself is odd and too coincidental as well. It was around this same time before the pandemic (2019 - 2020) that I started to plan for a "retirement". I wasn't retiring the way senior citizens or people with enough money do, but in the sense that I was forcing myself into unemployment, and as a result: homelessness, just so I could do nothing all day and the perverts wouldn't get any 

                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/memes/MATERIAL.jpg"> 
                    
                    <br><br>from it; they would be able to copy my daily actions/activities, as they have been previously, because there was nothing for them to copy. 
                    
                    <br><br>Apparently all my suffering was in vain, though, because lo and behold: what do the perverts do when they can't get material (for their shows, movies, music, etc.) from the person they stalk, harass, and copy 24/7? Put everything on pause and force the world to stop apparently - even if it means killing (what is it the number now?) MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.

                    <br><br>What else do the perverts do when they see the person they stalk, harass, and copy 24/7 doing absolutely nothing? Copy the fact that they're doing nothing apparently! Wasn't it around this time that Güí©me of Thrüí©nes ended their series with one of their main characters doing nothing? ü§î

                    <br><br>Also, it very well could be that Büí©den's attempt to get rid of T*kT*k was to artificially manufacture more tech layoffs, further preventing me, and THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE displaced because from the layoffs, from finding a job in that industry. The perverts couldn't continue colluding these simultaneous layoffs anymore, after I exposed them in <a href="/log/2024/08.html#08_13_2024">this</a>, so they resorted to turning their perversions into law. 

                    <br><br>You all wonder who was really in charge during Büí©den's senility? Well here you go.

                    <br><br>I guess it shouldn't be all that surprising that these perverts not only have the resources, but lack the morality, to do something as unethical as all of this, since they've been corrupting literally every company and person they can for the past 10+ years, just to force their rape codes and delusions into everything you interact with. 

                    <br><br>@D*naldTr*mp do you want to go down as the most beloved president in history? Maybe even secure a third term? Please eradicate these perverts from our society once and for all. Absolutely NO ONE will be sad to see these idiots imprisoned for all the perverted and corrupt things they've done to our society for the past 10+ years. I will tell you everything I know.
