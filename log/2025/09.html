                    <br><br>Perverts having another one of their minions reference the snake:

                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2025/09/09/image1.png">

                    <br><br>How many politicians is that now? Kind of weird, don't you think? That so many POLITICIANS keep referencing some uneducated idiot snake who's NEVER DONE ANYTHING IN POLITICS? It's almost like a <s>group</s> state of <a href="/perverts.html">perverts</a> are forcing them to do so. FYI: as a general rule of thumb, if you want to spot the politicians who are corrupt, all you have to do is look for the ones that do anything related to the snake. No joke. The perverts really that stupid and their methods really are that lazy.

                    <br><br>The perverts use the snake like they do any of their <a href="/rape_codes.html">rape codes</a>, as a sort of signature or signal to indicate that they've corrupted something. It's all very serial killer. 

                    <br><br>Didja' hear that taylorsnake? That's the only reason why you ever got as much presence in the media that you did. It's not because you're talented - because you're not; or artistic - because you're not; or original - because you're not; or intelligent - because you're not. You're just a plant for the perverts, to be used to elicit some kind of reaction from the person they stalk, whenever they need new ideas to steal.

                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/memes/REACTION.jpg">

                    <br><br>Side note: isn't it just HILARIOUS that this is the only way taylorsnake can make a presence in politics, by forcing politicians to say it's name or reference something about it that by no means has anything to do with politics. 🤣🤣🤣 See, if the snake were to have educated itself in anything politics and had anything substantial to add to any issue/topic of consequence, then perhaps said politicians could have referenced those ideas. But noooo, formulating ideas would require hard work on the snake's part, wouldn't it? Might as well take the lazy way out, like you do with plagiarizing right, taylorsnake? 🤷 Can't FAKE your way through this one!!

                    <br><br>Hey, pervert: f🖕ck you and get out of Washington. No one should EVER vote for someone like you. You are exactly the type of "politician" that Washington is overrun with these days; the ones who see their offices as more of a platform for fame and stardom than as a vehicle to serve the public. In other words: you are misusing and abusing your position of power to TAKE from the people rather give to them.
