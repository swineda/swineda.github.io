                    <br><br>Perverts having another one of their minions reference the snake:

                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2025/09/09/image1.png">

                    <br><br>How many politicians is that now? Kind of weird, don't you think? That so many POLITICIANS keep referencing some uneducated idiot snake who's NEVER DONE ANYTHING IN POLITICS? It's almost like a <s>group</s> state of <a href="/perverts.html">perverts</a> are forcing them to do so. FYI: as a general rule of thumb, if you want to spot the politicians that are corrupt, all you have to do is look for the ones that do anything related to the snake. No joke. The perverts really that stupid and their methods really are that lazy.

                    <br><br>The perverts use the snake like they do any of their <a href="/rape_codes.html">rape codes</a>, as a sort of signature or signal to indicate that they've corrupted something. It's all very serial killer. 

                    <br><br>Side note: isn't it just HILARIOUS that this is the only way taylorsnake can make a presence in politics, by forcing politicians to simply say it's name or reference something about it that by no means has anything to do with politics. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ See, if the snake were to have educated itself in anything politics and had anything substantial to add to any issue/topic of consequence, then perhaps said politicians could reference those ideas. But noooo, formulating ideas would require hard work on the snake's part, wouldn't it? Might as well take the lazy way out, like you do with plagiarizing, right taylorsnake? ðŸ¤· Can't FAKE your way through this one!!
