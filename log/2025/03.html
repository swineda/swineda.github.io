                    <br><br>Perverts force the D*mocrats in C*ngress to wear <a href="/rape_codes.html#pink">#pink</a> during Tr*mp's address. (This is another case where the perverts are <a href="/log/2025/02.html#10:19">"desperately trying to find codes that I haven't yet logged/recorded yet on this site and are therefor unaware to the public and unrecognizable to the unsuspecting, to use in their harassments"</a>)

                    <br><br>This <a href="/tricks.html#color_conditioning">color conditioning</a> is after I posted <a href="/log/2025/02.html#Downfalls-of-a-Party">this</a>. This is a good example of how sick and malicious these perverts' are in their attempted psychological abuse an gas lighting:
                    
                    <br><br>Because I wrote a post that seemingly speaks out against that party, they in turn wear a color that shows they're on my side! But how can they be on my side if they're using a rape code that was constructed from the violation of my privacy by perverts who have been stalking and harassing me for 10+ years? Also, they're <a href="/tricks.html#CausesAsPretenses">Women's Rights as a pretense</a> for this usage and perpetuation of the perverts' rape codes. And how can you say you're fighting for civil rights when you're violating mine? 

                    <br><br>Doesn't it suck how you can't wear any certain colors anymore? Blame the swine and snake for forcing these <a href="/rape_codes.html">rape codes</a> to become a thing!!!!

                    <br><br>Yeah. This is the type of mental illness that runs through this <a href="/perverts.html#taylorsnake">cüêçnt's</a> "brain" (if you can call it that.), and the type of psychological abuse and <a href="/log/2025/03.html#07:18">torture</a> it tries to inflict on my every day. It's so easy being a celebrity, isn't it taylorsnake? All you have to do is find some nobody and stalk and harass him nonstop until he gives you material for your plagiarized trash! No need to get an education or have any artistic ability or identity, or do any hard work yourself to make those billions! Just keep that in mind people: the next time you're working a job you don't like, trying to make ends meet, there's an idiot flying around in private jets corrupting companies to force itself onto magazine covers, play its plagiarisms on streaming services, and tricking society to the point where it made it made billions of dollars of its illegal activities.

                    <br><br>ANYWAY.

                    <br><br>The real tragedy in all of this is that the causes and ideals that this party fights for are no longer getting the support they need all because these perverts turned this party and their platform into a joke. 
                    
                    <br><br>The fact is: you should be supporting trans rights and women's rights and black rights. However, unfortunately for us, the perverts have used these human rights as a coded pretense for their delusions for so long, and have tried to trick us into supporting these causes for the wrong reasons - so much so that people have begun to reject them. Allow me to reiterate that in all caps for your posterity: PEOPLE ARE NO LONGER SUPPORTING EQUAL RIGHTS BECAUSE OF THESE PERVERTS' STUPIDITY. THIS IS THE EFFECT THAT THESE PERVERTS HAVE HAD ON OUR SOCIETY.
                    
                    <br><br>The perverts have forced us to see each other for our superficial qualities and fixate on these differences instead of focusing on our similarities and each others' actions and character. This goes against every message from the initial Civil Rights movements. And if you think about it: it makes perfect sense that this notion would come from the perverts, because they do not have a sense of character or ethics themselves. Don't you think it's strange that prior to the perverts, our society was making great strides in Civil Rights, and then as soon as the perverts started corrupting our society, we started regressing? Yea, it's not a coincidence. 

                    <br><br>D*mocrats: you want an answer to your current woes? It's really simple: choose authentic people to represent your party - ones that <a href="/log/2024/10.html#09:12">cannot be corrupted by the perverts</a>. (Psst: this may be why B*rnie and Tr*mp have been very popular with their respective bases; because they are both anti-establishment and don't put on any fronts/pretenses.)
                    
                    <br><br>And this is not exclusive to the D*mocrats, but any party for that matter. R*publicans: don't forget that N*xon made you guys look bad not too long ago.
                    
                    <br><br>If you're not getting the central and underlying theme/message yet, here it is: it doesn't matter what your sex, race, gender identity, political affiliation, etc. are. We are all capable of doing good and bad. What matters are your character and your actions - how you treat yourself and how you treat others.

                    <br><br>So don't fall for the perverts' idiotic line of "thinking". In fact, it's because of them that people have regressed into seeing the world and each other in such binary and <i>simple (minded)</i> terms, what with their <a href="/rape_codes.html#cats">cats</a> vs <a href="/rape_codes.html#dogs">dogs</a>, <a href="/rape_codes.html#red">red</a> vs <a href="/rape_codes.html#blue">blue</a>, <a href="/rape_codes.html#gold">gold</a> vs <a href="/rape_codes.html#silver">silver</a>, <a href="/rape_codes.html#sun">sun</a> vs <a href="/rape_codes.html#moon">moon</a>, <a href="/rape_codes.html#vampires">vampires</a> vs <a href="/rape_codes.html#werewolves">werewolves</a>. Naturally, when it came time for the perverts to <a href="https://medium.com/@taylorsnake/hey-taylorsnake-whats-a-filibuster-cdc398aff25c" target="_blank">infiltrate politics</a>, they would of course force us to see things as Democrats vs Republicans, to the point where we can't meet in the middle and come to any consensus.

                    <br><br>Perverts plagiarize my work from a job application and forced it into a G*P campaign.
                    
                    <br><br>I submitted an application to D*taAnn*tation and had the foresight to record my answers knowing that it would be a matter of time until the perverts ripped my ideas once again.

                    <br><br>Get it? Because the I wrote about characters being in an elevator, the perverts then forced the people in that G*P campaign to be in an elevator!!!!! Good thing I didn't write about characters getting enemas!

                    <br><br>This is also an example of <a href="/tricks.html#baiting">baiting</a>. Note how the "G*pX New" button is <a href="/rape_codes.html#blue">blue</a>, but when you scroll over it, it reveals a drop down menu with an image of people who have <a href="/rape_codes.html#red">red</a> hair! Aren't the perverts just the stupidest, wasteful harm to our existence ever? 

                    <br><br>Also note how they titled the campaign "<s>Mama's</s> Pervert's Eyes" because

                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/memes/HES_MY_SON.jpg">

                    <br><br>and it's violating - I mean "watching" me!

                    <br><br>This is the type of thing that makes the fashion industry look bad; adverts that are superficial and have no sense or depth. You're literally posing in an elevator... WHY? What does that have to do with the clothing line or campaign? For what reason other than the fact that the perverts saw me write about an elevator and needed to copy it, as part of their cult's ritual, could you possibly force people into an elevator and take pictures of them and think that was some kind of thoughtful, elevated piece of art?
                    
                    <br><br>Again: <a href="/log/2025/02.html#10:19"> This is type of thing that should insult your intelligence - the fact that these perverts think they can get away with perverse and corrupt acts by simply covering it up with some half-üêñssed slop.</a> And yet the snake, who's responsible for this de-elevation and crappening of art, is being forced onto the covers of V*gue and other magazines? Again, why? Oh that's right: payola and corruption ü§∑ 
                    
                    <br><br>But of course the snake and the perverts would force companies to think plagiarism is a valid way of making "art" because that's what the snake has been doing with all of it's trash. It has simply been using these pervert codes that are <a href="/log/2025/02.html#10:19">"unrecognizable to the unsuspecting"</a> to shit out these cryptic-y passive-aggressive bullshit lyrics that are serve as attacks on the same people it's ripping off. Sorry to all of you who fell for the snake's false narrative of wanting you to believe it's some deep artist. Just because something is cryptic doesn't make it deep! Ask yourself: how can you pretend to be deep and know anything about life when your "identity" (or lack thereof) is a collective plagiarism of others'?

                    <br><br>And here's another observation/read on how much of waste of trash this snake is: with all the resources it has from being able to corrupt companies and people, plus the BILLIONS of dollars it made from the such, it chooses to force companies to talk about itself, the cheap drama it creates for its life, and make them look like it's something it's not: the popular high school cheerleader it wishes it was. I mean really. All that corruption of our society just to enact vain and self-serving büêçllshit? How irresponsible and unit this idiot to handle any kind of "power". And THIS is why these perverts have to act behind the scenes with their corruptions. Because the public would never knowingly entrust public offices or positions of power (that have the ability to affect billions of peoples's lives) to such idiots.

                    <br><br>Want to hear the kicker? I never even got a response from D*taAnn*tation even though my answers were spot on! And apparently everyone gets a response from them! This is how bad the perverts want to keep me from getting a high-paying job, so I'm not able to save enough money and retire and/or get the hüêçll out of this country and away from them!
