                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2025/08/16/image1.png">
                    
                    <br><br>First of all: it's not just "men", it's EVERYONE. So, you might want to correct that title.
                    
                    <br><br>Second: this is the type of polarizing, self-serving, PR bullshüêçt that brought our society to where it is today.
                    
                    <br><br>ICYMI: the snake's fake feminism is the reason why there's been such a backlash against women. TLDR: circa 2013/14, taylorsnake's tired trick of using people as material for its plagiarisms became more well known resulting in people not wanting to be around it. With no one to use to make itself look like a victim, it changed its approach from singling out a specific person to targeting an entire group of people. In classic taylorsnake fashion, it could only lift itself up by putting someone down (IE: via bullying and victimhood), so in the case of its fake feminism, it tried to trick people into believing it's some kind of women's rights activist by making itself look like the victim of men - ALL MEN.
                    
                    <br><br>What is problematic about this is that, for impressionable minds, it made people adopt the snake's toxic pathology and outlook on life and society, thinking that women are victims and men are toxic and oppressive. 
                    
                    <br><br>However, in reality, prior to our society's regression in 2015, women were already becoming more prevalent and the centerpoint in media and culture. And this was happening organically - not through force or subversion. Meanwhile, men were softening up and becoming more in touch with their feminity.
                    
                    <br><br>But because of the snake's narcissism, selfishness, and stupidity, it had to undo all of that progress. The snake and the perverts <a href="/tricks.html#CausesAsPretenses">weaponized a good cause</a> to the point of extremism; is it any wonder that after 10+ YEARS of constant bashing and being scapegoated as the enemy (of women and society in general) men have become marginalized and radicalized? And now look at where we are presently: are we better off than where were prior to 2015? Are we more unified? Has the gender gap shrunk? No. There was no progress. In fact, the snake's fake feminism did more harm than good to the people it claimed to be supporting: framing women as victims is actually disempowering, and makes women look weak and helpless. And by teaching women to weaponize this victimhood, you make them look manipulative, just like you.
                    
                    <br><br>Case and point: how many times has the snake's minions screeched at people to stop being "mean" to it whenever it's rightfully called out in public? If the snake were in fact a strong, independent woman, then it would be able to defend itself, no? This was even the same pathology that followed Kü•ómala's F*X interview. People said Br*t was "bullying" her and being "mean" to her by simply asking her questions... <i>in an interview</i>. Again: if Kü•ómala were a strong, independent woman, then she would be able to speak for and defend herself, no? Furthermore, Kü•ómala was a <a href="https://tuckercarlson.com/tucker-show-harmeet-dhillon" target="_blank">District Attorney</a>! She should be able to handle a simple interview. And if she's not, then she shouldn't be running for President!

                    <br><br><i>PS: Anyone else think it's funny how she's doing more interviews now, for her book, than when she was actually running for President?</i>
                    
                    <br><br>***
                    
                    <br><br>Let this also be an indication of how little taylorsnake cares about anyone and our country/society, and how much it cares about itself. That even after Rüá∑üá∫ssiagate, all the blatant corruption from this past election, and censorship and fraud from the past decade or so, the snake is STILL trying to fill our public consciousness with fake, self-serving PR news of itself just so it can regain some semblance of its facade and keep up the lifestyle it was able to make from defrauding you, prior to the debunking of its fake status as "biggest celebrity in the world".
                    
                    <br><br>For years, the snake and perverts have tried to make you fall for their delusion of the snake being the "biggest celebrity in the world" by corrupting things they can control: news, print, and other medias. But the true tests of reality came in settings that the perverts could not control, such as: the snake repelling people from Kü•ómala after it endorsed her, and people booing the snake at a football game. Do you think that if taylorsnake were actually universally loved as it thinks it is, any of those things would have happened?
                    
                    <br><br>Our society has come to a place where it is yearning for transparency, accountability and healing, and the snake is trying get in the way of that by putting out more of the same shüí©t as before. Don't let it. 
                    
                    <br><br>Tell me, snake, why do you even think you deserve to be famous? It would be one thing if you had found a cure for a disease, or were the most skilled/athletic of anything, but you've done, and are none, of those things. You often like to use K*m K*rdashian, who's been criticized as being famous for doing nothing, as some kind of foil to make yourself look better by comparison (even though you hypocritically whine about people pitting women against each other (just to make people stop justly criticizing you) üôÑü§∑), but you're so much worse than that. You're uneducated, you're not artistic, you have no substance, originality, or identity of your own, and all of the trash you've ever shüêçtted out are STOLEN plagiarisms of other peoples' ideas and/or passive-aggressive attacks on people you've used to make yourself look like the victim. There's absolutely no reason you should be celebrated, much less live better off than any person who actually makes an <i>honest</i> living for themselves and their loved ones.

                    <br><br>A few months ago, I won a some prizes by playing a game at an arcade. 
                    
                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2025/08/14/image1.png">
                    
                    <br><br>The perverts couldn't stand the idea of me having a person/place/thing/object which I only had good associations with, so it corrupts that same arcade by forcing it to put one of the snake's plagiarism as a "prize", which in the mentally-ill swine's and snake's minds is <a href="/tricks.html#turning">turning</a> the establishment and memory against me.
    
                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/2025/08/14/image2.png">
    
                    <br><br>@FBI: if you really want to track down and eradicate the düêñüí©p ssstüêçte, you might want to add this establishment to your list of investigations.

                    <br><br>***
    
                    <br><br>First of all: no kid (...or adult ...or self-respecting human) wants that.
    
                    <br><br>Second: it's kind of funny how the gay community is often accused of "grooming" the young, when the snake is the thing that's most culpable of that. The snake is the one preying on the unsuspecting and impressionable young minds of future generations and turning them into self-centered, vain, inauthentic, passive-aggressive minions. Is it any wonder that after being forced to witness decades - I mean "ERüêçSssss" ü§Æ - of the snake passive-aggressively attacking everybody/everything it can use to make itself look like the victim, people have been conditioned to behave as lazy, superficial, and ghoulish as the snake, to the point where they form face-value opinions about someone from PR-driven, propagandized, out-of-context clips and sound bites instead of doing the hard work of actually watching the source of said clips/sounds bites in full context before forming prejudices? ... And then go on to <i>celebrate</i> such persons' deaths?
                    
                    <br><br><img src="/assets/images/memes/snake-unknown.png">
                    
                    <br><br>These passive-aggressive attacks might seem harmless, but what they're really teaching people (especially said impressionable future generations) is to be spineless, by not having the backbone to speak to someone directly, and to be misanthropic, by anticipating and relishing in the harmful and damaging effect/outcome that such a passive-aggressive attack would cause a person. And what's especially sssinister is how the snake always tries to package itself/its PR facade as some kind of innocent, wholesome victim (to try and lure people/kids in, like a pedo), but in reality, underneath that facade, it's anything but - in fact, it's like the most vitriolic thing to have ever plagued our society. Would someone that is innocent and wholesome spend their existence launching calculated, malicious attacks on people?
                    
                    <br><br>Passive-aggressive attacks are just a form of psychological abuse. By exposing young, impressionable minds to the snake, it is grooming the innocent to become future generations of psychopathic abusers. Case and point: turning an arcade - a place of fun - into a tool for revenge and hatred against someone you've been stalking 24/7 for "ERüêçSssss" ü§Æ.
    
                    <br><br>***

                    <br><br>Once again: füêçck you, you spineless, uneducated, talentless cüêçnt. Bet you can't say anything like that to me directly can you, snake? 
                    
                    <br><br>And now that I've outed another one of your snakey actions/said something bad about you, why don't you go on and plague society with another one of your coded, passive-aggressive "songs" or "videos" to try and bury the truth? Go on, prove me right.
