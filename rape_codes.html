            <p>logged 04/15/2025</p>
            <p>Meant to be a derogatory term to infer that the person the perverts are stalking is mentally-ill. Originated from one of the fugly swine's plagiarized slops (the one where the main character basically goes around committing adultery and corrupting parts of the government - oh hey, guess that was a <a href="/log/2025/01.html#For-Some-Reason">precursor to recent IRL events!</a> Yay! The swine gets to live out its deluded fantasy's at this nation's expense!), where they were saying something "about not feeding the birds"</p>


            <h1 id="bw">Black & White</h1>
            <p>Refers to me. It is often used along with the perverts' other rape-code, red, to create and depict opposition (IE: red vs. black & white). In terms of conditioning, perverts use this code/color for positive reinforcement.
            </p>


            <h1 id="blonde">Blonde</h1>
            <p>Refers to me. Originate from a personal and private phone conversation from 2016, where my friend asked for styling tips and I suggested platinum blonde.

            <h1 id="desert">Desert</h1>
            <p>Based on the other rape code, <a href="/rape_codes.html#water">water</a>. Is used to refer or show support/allegiance to the group of perverts and/or show opposition to me, since deserts are places that have no water. 
            <br><br><i>yeah. great. good job, idiots. why don't you go move the desert and see how long you can last without any water.</i>

            </p>


            <h1 id="dogs">Dogs</h1>
            <p>Refers to the group of perverts. It is derived from a private conversation between myself and a friend (that the perverts were listening to) wherein I said I didn't like the noise that a neighbor's dog was creating; this statement was taken out of context to make it look as though I didn't like all dogs in general (even though I've owned 2 dogs in the past). 
            <br><br>It is often used along with perverts' other rape-code, cats, to create and depict opposition (IE: cats vs. dogs). With regards to conditioning, perverts use this code for negative reinforcement.

            <h1 id="gold">Gold</h1>

            <h1 id="jesus">Jesus, God, Christianity</h1>
            <p>Refers to me; is often used in a mocking way.
            <br><br>For those who are unaware of its double-meaning, the perverts' mocking tone sets a precedent to allow ridicule of a religion or anyone who believes in a religion.
            </p>


            <h1 id="moon">Moon, Night, Nighttime</h1>
            <p>Refers to the group of perverts. It is often used along with the perverts' other rape-code, <a href="/rape_codes.html#sun">sun</a>, to create and depict opposition (IE: sun vs. moon).
            </p>


            <h1 id="muppets">Muppets</h1>
            <p>Comes from an episode of swineda's trash series <i>ScðŸ’©ndal</i>, where one of the characters running for Vice President is called a muppet, in a derogatory way. This was swineda's way of calling me a muppet after listening to my personal conversations. OF COURSE something with no personality or charm or humor would think someone with those qualities would be a muppet. I mean, have you seen that thing talk? It's like the definition of derp.
            <br><br><img src="/assets/images/memes/HES_MY_SON.jpg"> 
            <br><br>Also funny how it thinks it can judge me when, if there's anything that should be judged, it's itself: the obese pervert whose stalking someone less than half its age for the entirety of its existence and thinks its some kind of accomplishment.
            <br><br>Also a great of example of how it uses its plagiarism - I mean "shows" - as a platform for levying indirect malicious attacks at others...much like <a href="/perverts.html/#taylorsnake">taylorsnake</a> and its own plagiarism - I mean "songs".
