            <h1 id="muppets">Muppets</h1>
            <p>Comes from an episode of swineda's trash series <i>ScðŸ’©ndal</i>, where one of the characters running for Vice President is called a muppet, in a derogatory way. This was swineda's way of calling me a muppet after listening to my personal conversations. OF COURSE something with no personality or charm or humor would think someone with those qualities would be a muppet. I mean, have you seen that thing talk? It's like the definition of derp.
            <br><br><img src="/assets/images/memes/HES_MY_SON.jpg"> 
            <br><br>Also funny how it thinks it can judge me when, if there's anything that should be judged, it's itself: the obese pervert whose stalking someone less than half its age for the entirety of its existence and thinks its some kind of accomplishment.
            <br><br>Also a great of example of how it uses its plagiarism - I mean "shows" - as a platform for levying indirect malicious attacks at others...much like <a href="/perverts.html/#taylorsnake">taylorsnake</a> and its own plagiarism - I mean "songs".</p>
