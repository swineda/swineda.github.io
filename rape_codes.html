            <p></p>Refers to me. It is often used along with the perverts' other rape-code, red, to create and depict opposition (IE: red vs. blue). In terms of conditioning, perverts use this code/color for positive reinforcement.

            <h1 id="cats">Cats</h1>
            <p></p>Refers to me. It is often used along with the perverts' other rape-code, dogs, to create and depict opposition (IE: cats vs. dogs). In terms of conditioning, perverts use this code for positive reinforcement.
            
            <h1 id="dogs">Dogs</h1>
            <p>Refers to the group of perverts. It is derived from a private conversation between myself and a friend (that the perverts were listening to) wherein I said I didn't like the noise that a neighbor's dog was creating; this statement was taken out of context to make it look as though I didn't like all dogs in general (even though I've owned 2 dogs in the past). 
            <br><br>It is often used along with perverts' other rape-code, cats, to create and depict opposition (IE: cats vs. dogs). With regards to conditioning, perverts use this code for negative reinforcement.

            <h1 id="gold">Gold</h1>
            <p></p>Refers to me. It is often used along with the perverts' other rape-code, silver, to create and depict opposition (IE: gold vs. silver). In terms of conditioning, perverts use this code/color for positive reinforcement.

            <p></p>

            <h1 id="muppets">Muppets</h1>
            <p>Comes from an episode of swineda's trash series <i>ScðŸ’©ndal</i>, where one of the characters running for Vice President is called a muppet, in a derogatory way. This was swineda's way of calling me a muppet after listening to my personal conversations. OF COURSE something with no personality or charm or humor would think someone with those qualities would be a muppet. I mean, have you seen that thing talk? It's like the definition of derp.
            <br><br><img src="/assets/images/memes/HES_MY_SON.jpg"> 
            <br><br>Also funny how it thinks it can judge me when, if there's anything that should be judged, it's itself: the obese pervert whose stalking someone less than half its age for the entirety of its existence and thinks its some kind of accomplishment.
            <br><br>Also a great of example of how it uses its plagiarism - I mean "shows" - as a platform for levying indirect malicious attacks at others...much like <a href="/perverts.html/#taylorsnake">taylorsnake</a> and its own plagiarism - I mean "songs".</p>

            <h1 id="red">Red</h1>
            <p></p>Refers to the group of perverts. It is often used along with perverts' other rape-code, blue, to create and depict opposition (IE: red vs. blue). In terms of conditioning, the perverts use this code for negative reinforcement.

            <h1 id="silver">Silver</h1>
            <p>Refers to the group of perverts and is often used interchangeably with gray.
