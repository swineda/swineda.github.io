            <h1 id="basicHaircut">The Basic Haircut</h1>
            <p>The shoulder length haircut that the perverts forced to become a thing circa 2015. The perverts use this haircut as a code to signal that they've corrupted/turned an individual against me, by forcing that person to get this type of haircut. The code originated from one of swine's plagiarisms, ðŸ’©'s Anatomy, during the season where it forced all the actresses in the plagiarism to get this type of haircut. This haircut is also meant to reference the mop taylorsnake was sporting on its head the time. The perverts forced this haircut on pretty much all female celebrities in HðŸ’©llywood - despite their reservations (see YouT*be video of Ad*le doing CðŸ’©rpool KðŸ’©raoke, wherein she says she didn't want to get the haircut because it made her look like a soccer mom), and nearly all fictional female characters in anything NðŸ’©ntendo, DðŸ’©sney, etc. Side note: let this be an indication of how the perverts view style/fashion (and ultimately you, as the consumer): as something that people will mindlessly adopt so long as you force it in enough places. Any self-respecting artist should be offended by this notion.</p>

            <p>logged 04/15/2025</p>
            <p>Meant to be a derogatory term to infer that the person the perverts are stalking is mentally-ill. Originated from one of the fugly swine's plagiarized slops (the one where the main character basically goes around committing adultery and corrupting parts of the government - oh hey, guess that was a <a href="/log/2025/01.html#For-Some-Reason">precursor to recent IRL events!</a> Yay! The swine gets to live out its deluded fantasy's at this nation's expense!), where they were saying something "about not feeding the birds"</p>


            <h1 id="bw">Black & White</h1>
            <p>Refers to me. It is often used along with the perverts' other rape-code, red, to create and depict opposition (IE: red vs. black & white). In terms of conditioning, perverts use this code/color for positive reinforcement.
            </p>


            <h1 id="blonde">Blonde</h1>
            <p>Refers to me. Originate from a personal and private phone conversation from 2016, where my friend asked for styling tips and I suggested platinum blonde.

            </p>


            <h1 id="curlyHair">Curly Hair</h1>
            <p>A hairstyle the perverts forced to become a thing, following the <a href="/rape_codes.html#basicHaircut">basicHaircut</a>. The perverts use this hairstyle as a code to signal that they've corrupted/turned an individual against me, by forcing them to get this type of hairstyle. (Over time, the perverts would conflate curly hair with wavy hair.) This code originated around the time PðŸ’©kÃ©mon SwðŸ’©rd and ShðŸ’©eld was set to launch. SwðŸ’©rd and ShðŸ’©eld takes place in a Scotland-like setting, and are the games that were originally supposed to follow G*neration 6, had the perverts not forced NðŸ’©ntendo to make a game set in <a href="/rape_codes.html#Hawaii">Hawaii</a> instead, to prime people for the launch of <i>MðŸ’©ana</i>. The perverts tried to retroactively claim Scotland as a rape code, to make these games' settings seem intended and to give off the appearance that they have control over the company's doings, by forcing Scotland everywhere in the medias, such as videos on popular streaming sites at that time (EG: <i>The ðŸ’©utlaw King</i>, that Loch Ness monster movie that was added on NðŸ’©tflix at the time). The perverts also forced the movie, <i>BrðŸ’©ve</i>, to play on cable television essentially every week, to prime people for this launch. The perverts chose this movie specifically because the plot revolves around a mother-daughter relationship, wherein the daughter has curly hair.</p>

            <p>Based on the other rape code, <a href="/rape_codes.html#water">water</a>. Is used to refer or show support/allegiance to the group of perverts and/or show opposition to me, since deserts are places that have no water.

            <h1 id="dogs">Dogs</h1>
            <p>Refers to the group of perverts. It is derived from a private conversation between myself and a friend (that the perverts were listening to) wherein I said I didn't like the noise that a neighbor's dog was creating; this statement was taken out of context to make it look as though I didn't like all dogs in general (even though I've owned 2 dogs in the past). 
            <br><br>It is often used along with perverts' other rape-code, cats, to create and depict opposition (IE: cats vs. dogs). With regards to conditioning, perverts use this code for negative reinforcement.

            <p>Refers to me; is often used in a mocking way.
            <br><br>For those who are unaware of its double-meaning, the perverts' mocking tone sets a precedent to allow ridicule of a religion or anyone who believes in a religion.

            </p>


            <h1 id="muppets">Muppets</h1>
            <p>Comes from an episode of swineda's trash series <i>ScðŸ’©ndal</i>, where one of the characters running for Vice President is called a muppet, in a derogatory way. This was swineda's way of calling me a muppet after listening to my personal conversations. OF COURSE something with no personality or charm or humor would think someone with those qualities would be a muppet. I mean, have you seen that thing talk? It's like the definition of derp.
            <br><br><img src="/assets/images/memes/HES_MY_SON.jpg"> 
            <br><br>Also funny how it thinks it can judge me when, if there's anything that should be judged, it's itself: the obese pervert whose stalking someone less than half its age for the entirety of its existence and thinks its some kind of accomplishment.
            <br><br>Also a great of example of how it uses its plagiarism - I mean "shows" - as a platform for levying indirect malicious attacks at others...much like <a href="/perverts.html/#taylorsnake">taylorsnake</a> and its own plagiarism - I mean "songs".
