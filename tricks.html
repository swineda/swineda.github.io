            <p>When the perverts try to manipulate me into thinking I'm the reason for something bad happening (usually to myself or in my personal life) when in reality they are at the root cause of the misfortune and are behind the scenes engineering the situation to ensure the misfortune happens</p>

            <h1 id="opposite_trick">Doing the oPpoSitE of what they're accused of or called out for</h1>
            <p>When the perverts say or do the opposite of something they've been accused of as a way of trying to discredit the claims and/or the person asserting the claims.</p>
            <p><a href="perverts.html#swineda">swineda</a> and <a href="perverts.html#taylorsnake">taylorsnake</a> in particular get off from using this trick because they thinks it helps them get away with whatever crime or perversion its committing. They thinks they're smart and people are stupid because all they have to do is say/or do the opposite of something in order for people not to believe the accusations. They think of the whole situation as some kind of game where the objective/goal is to commit some sort of crime/perversion and then discredit any accusation afterward so they can get away with the crime and repeat the process all over again.</p>

            <h1 id="mimicry">Mimicry and mockery</h1>
            <p>Talking in public about private things in the target's life. Mimicking actions of the target. Basically letting the target know that they are in the target's life. Daily interferences, nothing that would be too overt to the untrained eye, but psychologically degrading and damaging to the target over time.
            <br><br>Perverts also use this trick to try and stop from doing something they don't like (such as exposing an illegal activity they've committed), thinking that if they mock me I will be embarrassed/humiliated enough and stop said action.

            <h1 id="noise_campaigns">Noise campaigns</h1>
            <p>Disrupting the target's life, sleep with loud power tools, construction, stereos, doors slamming, etc. Daily interferences, nothing that would be too overt to the untrained eye, but psychologically degrading and damaging to the target over time.</p>
            <p>Perverts use this trick as a form of "punishment" for saying/doing something that they don't like (EG: revealing one of their crimes)</p>
            <p>Perverts also use this trick to try and get me to give them material on cue.</p>
